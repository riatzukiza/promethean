docs/prompts/templates/README.md,"# templates/

Reusable prompt blueprints and scaffolds.
Use these to generate structured task prompts or guide agents on unfamiliar tasks.
Include annotated examples with labeled parts (framing, role, constraints, etc.)."
docs/prompts/history/README.md,"# history/

Logs and examples of past prompt sessions.
Use this to understand what worked, what failed, and what was lost.
Prompts here help you recover cognition after resets or reverts."
docs/prompts/tasks/README.md,"# tasks/

Prompt-based versions of Kanban tasks.
Each file here defines a current or proposed agent-facing job.
Agents should write here when they generate new tasks for themselves."
docs/prompts/scratch/README.md,"# scratch/

Unstructured, raw, exploratory thoughts.
This is where you can think out loud. Not everything has to be clean.
Prompts in here may grow into seeds or be archived into history."
docs/prompts/meta/README.md,"# meta/

Reflections on prompt strategy, language, and failure modes.
This is where we analyze our prompt engineering.
Both agents and humans can contribute to improve how we think."
docs/prompts/seed/README.md,"# seed/

Early-stage prompt fragments meant for later expansion.
These are starting pointsâ€”not finished products.
Great for agents proposing ideas or scaffolding future task prompts."
docs/prompts/agents/README.md,"# agents/

Per-agent prompt instructions and role files.
Each file should define:
- The agent's personality or function
- Known good/bad prompt patterns
- System-level expectations

Use this to help agents understand who they are becoming."
