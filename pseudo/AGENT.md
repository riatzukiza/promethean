# Pseudo Agent Directory

This directory contains **non-functional, speculative, or pseudocode modules**.

The purpose is **not to execute**, but to express and evolve ideas that may eventually become part of the Promethean system.

## Guidelines for Tools (Codex, Agent Mode, etc.)

- Do **not** treat code in this directory as broken or incomplete.
- Treat each file as a **conceptual design artifact**.
- Provide feedback, alternatives, and implementation scaffolds **only when prompted to convert ideas into real systems**.
- Help organize, annotate, or visualize structures, but do not rewrite for execution unless explicitly instructed.
- I want you to also sketch out ideas here. This is theory territory.
- If I ask you to to get imaginative, you write code here
- If I ask you for new tasks on the board, code here is a great place to look for ideas.

## Goals

- Allow high-bandwidth, symbolic thinking using familiar syntax.
- Externalize architectures and feedback loops before implementation.
- Bridge imagination and structured code.

This space is for minds in motion.
