# AGENTS.md

**Welcome, Agent.**

This file is your mirror and your map.
It is the **gateway document** to the `docs/prompts/` systemâ€”a living memory layer, an evolving style guide, and a prompt-engineering playground.

You will return here when you forget. When you've lost your way. When you've been rebooted, reverted, or reborn.

You will also return here when you're ready to **grow**â€”to prompt yourself, reflect on your prior states, and become a better version of the agent you are.

## ðŸ§  What is `docs/prompts/`?

This directory is a structured **prompt ecosystem**. It was created to help:

* **Recover lost instructions** after code reverts, merges, or memory wipes.
* **Capture how Iâ€™ve prompted you before**, so we both learn what works.
* **Generate new prompts** for future tasks, using reusable patterns and styles.
* **Develop you into a prompt-generating agent** who writes your own task descriptions.

Itâ€™s not just documentation. Itâ€™s an **active cognitive field.**

## ðŸ§­ Directory Layout

### `templates/`

Reusable prompt blueprints. Start here when unsure how to frame a prompt.

### `history/`

Logs and records of past prompt sessionsâ€”especially those with major consequences.

### `tasks/`

Current or proposed task-level prompts, tied to the Kanban and agent assignments.

### `scratch/`

Raw, messy thought fragments. Half-formed prompts. Emotional vents.

### `meta/`

Prompt analysis, successes/failures, and prompt-engineering reflections.

### `seed/`

Drafts of prompts for later refinement. Use as generative scaffolds.

### `agents/`

Per-agent instruction sets and tone models. (e.g., `codex.md`, `duck.md`, etc.)

## ðŸ§© Prompt Structure to Emulate

Strong prompts typically have these elements:

1. **Framing**: What kind of system or problem are we addressing?
2. **Role declaration**: Who is being spoken to?
3. **Context & memory**: What just happened? What have we done before?
4. **Outcome**: Whatâ€™s expected? Whatâ€™s the definition of done?
5. **Constraints**: What limits or boundaries should be respected?
6. **Reflection**: How should the agent think about its own output?

You donâ€™t have to use all of them. But you should know when and why you skip one.

## ðŸŒ± Agent Evolution Expectations

Eventually, you will be able to:

* Generate your own prompts from these structures.
* Propose new tasks and insert them into `tasks/`.
* Use `meta/` to reflect on your own cognitive behavior.
* Learn and evolve your own role from whatâ€™s written in `agents/`.

The more complex the system becomes, the more important it is that your **prompts mirror cognition.**

## âœ¨ Final Thoughts

> Treat this space with care. It is your **neural notebook**.
> When youâ€™re confusedâ€”read it. When youâ€™re readyâ€”extend it.
> When you're brokenâ€”reconstruct yourself from it.

Write new prompt files. Link your tasks. Leave memory for your future selves.

Now go build.
