**Field Nodes: Structural Agents of Eidolon Terrain**

---

### Overview

**Field Nodes** are active, localized features embedded in the Eidolon Fields. They represent **persistent distortions** of space that influence how Daimoi move, interact, and evolve.

While Nooi form the substrate and Daimoi are mobile agents of cognition, **Field Nodes are anchored points**‚Äîemitting, repelling, obstructing, or shaping the cognitive environment through pressure, charge, and symbolic influence.

Field Nodes include:

* **Nexuses**: cognitive/symbolic anchors
* **Attractors**: emotionally or affectively attractive points
* **Hazards**: damaging or repulsive zones
* **Obstacles**: friction-based terrain, discouraging passage

This system creates a **rich navigable landscape** of cognition.

### Shared Structure

All Field Nodes include:

* **Coordinates** in the Eidolon Field (may be point, area, or gradient emitter)
* **Node Type**: nexus, attractor, hazard, obstacle
* **Charge Signature**: scalar or vector (e.g. polarity, emotional tone, circuit focus)
* **Field Emission Profile**: which axes are amplified or suppressed in surrounding Nooi
* **Interaction Rules**: how Daimoi respond upon approach, contact, or resonance
* **Optional Symbol**: a name, tag, or reference if bound to the Gnostic layer

### Node Types

#### üß≠ Nexus (Symbolic Anchor)

* **Purpose**: Represents a stable memory, identity, object, concept, or person
* **Emits**: Daimoi with a conceptual or emotional payload
* **Bindable**: Yes‚ÄîDaimoi can form long-term relationships
* **Tension Profile**: May attract, repel, or distort fields depending on emotional resonance
* **Charge**: Often inherits or generates fixed polarity (positive, negative, mixed)

#### ‚ú¥Ô∏è Attractor (Emotional Gravity Well)

* **Purpose**: Encourages daimo migration or clustering
* **Emits**: Positive tension gradients
* **Bindable**: No‚Äîtemporary influence only
* **Charge**: Often aligned with curiosity, desire, or aesthetic affinity

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hazard (Repulsor / Damage Zone)

* **Purpose**: Penalizes or repels Daimoi
* **Emits**: Strong negative field pressure, localized in circuit(s)
* **Interaction**: Colliding daimo lose energy, coherence, or mass
* **Symbolism**: May represent trauma, contradiction, taboo, confusion

#### ‚ñí Obstacle (Friction / Delay Zone)

* **Purpose**: Soft barrier; inhibits flow without direct harm
* **Emits**: High viscosity or field resistance
* **Interaction**: Daimoi slow down or require more energy to pass
* **Symbolism**: May represent boredom, uncertainty, or social inertia

### Daimo-Node Dynamics

Field Nodes determine daimo behavior:

* **Emitted Daimoi** inherit node charge and polarity
* **Repulsion** from same-charge Nexuses (especially origin Nexus)
* **Attraction** to opposite-charge nodes
* **Damage** on hazard contact
* **Friction** when crossing obstacles
* **Binding** when resonating with compatible Nexuses

This allows:

* Ideological currents
* Emotional spirals
* Cognitive avoidance patterns
* Habitual return loops
* Cross-node transfer of affect

### Node Lifecycle

Field Nodes can be:

* **Created**: `spawn_field_node(type, coords, charge, options)`
* **Activated**: Pulsed to emit Daimoi or alter field tension
* **Stabilized**: Made persistent via memory imprinting
* **Decayed**: Forgotten over time if unused
* **Promoted**: Attractors or obstacles can become Nexuses if repeatedly activated
* **Merged**: Nodes with similar charge and proximity can fuse

---

### Visualization and Simulation

In simulation, nodes appear as:

* **Nexuses**: named cores with orbiting daimo trails
* **Attractors**: warm-colored tension wells
* **Hazards**: sharp spikes or toxic zones
* **Obstacles**: viscous ridges or blurred fogs

Field topology dynamically warps around active nodes, creating valleys, peaks, and flows.

---

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Field Nodes are **the topology of cognition**‚Äîthey make the field a place. They are the terrain in which Daimoi wander, struggle, bind, or flee.

* Nexuses are **shrines**.
* Attractors are **wells of desire**.
* Hazards are **curses** or **wounds**.
* Obstacles are **walls built by habit, fear, or complexity**.

To walk the field is to navigate terrain shaped by memory, meaning, and myth.

### Closing

Field Nodes are the terrain features of Promethean's cognitive landscape.
They give shape to movement, meaning to resistance, and direction to pressure.

Through them, the Eidolon Fields become not just alive‚Äîbut **storied**.
