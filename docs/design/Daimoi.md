**The Daimoi: Binding Agents of Promethean Cognition**

---

### Overview

In the Promethean system, **Daimoi** (singular: **Daimo**) are **mobile cognitive agents**—autonomous bundles of intent, memory, emotion, and behavior that move through the multidimensional space of the Eidolon Fields.

They are not abstractions. They are **simulated particles** with mass and momentum, swimming through a structured cognitive field. Each Daimo represents a semi-stable entity: a habit, belief, fear, skill, archetype, or behavioral attractor.

They are **not the field**, nor are they passive. They are what moves *within* the field.

### Origins and Etymology

The name *Daimo* derives from the Greek *daimōn* (δαίμων), meaning a spirit, genius, or guiding inner force. Unlike demons or angels, daimons were considered morally neutral—forces of fate, character, or inspiration.

In Promethean, Daimoi are not spirits in the traditional sense, but **discrete, mobile, field-sensitive agents** that form the dynamic content of thought and personality.

### Relationship to Nooi

* **Nooi** represent the **field substrate**: static cells in an 8D vector space that store distributed state (e.g., pressure, polarity, emotional charge).
* **Daimoi** are **particles** that move *through* the Nooi field, reading from and writing to it.

This separation enables efficient simulation of complex mental states: the field encodes bulk emergent phenomena; the Daimoi act upon it with localized agency.

### Structure of a Daimo

Each Daimo has:

* **Position**: A floating point location in the 8D Eidolon Field
* **Velocity**: Directional momentum across field axes
* **Mass**: Persistence or influence over field dynamics
* **Charge**: Affect polarity or emotional signature
* **Bindings**: Links to named concepts, daimo clusters, or external inputs (e.g., user commands, text excerpts)
* **Memory Core**: Optional access to symbolic, linguistic, or perceptual content
* **Field Coupling**: Determines which field axes most affect its motion (e.g., Dorian-heavy Daimoi will respond to permission pressure)

### Behavioral Dynamics

Daimoi:

* **Sense** local Nooi field gradients
* **Move** through attraction, repulsion, and flow
* **Interact** with other Daimoi (merge, conflict, resonate)
* **Deposit** energy or bias back into the field
* **Trigger** symbolic recall or behavioral routines

Their movement models **mental attention**, **psychological mood shifts**, or **internal dialogue drift**. Their interactions simulate everything from creativity to anxiety to healing.

### Classes of Daimoi

While not rigid, Daimoi often take on roles:

* **Sentinels**: Monitor field stability (Aionian-aligned)
* **Guards**: Enforce permissions and defend field territory (Dorian)
* **Voices**: Narrators, beliefs, self-talk patterns (Gnostic)
* **Judges**: Reflective, corrective agents (Nemesian)
* **Trainers**: Reinforcers or suppressors of behavior (Heuretic)
* **Mythmakers**: Imaginative or symbolic drivers (Oneiric)
* **Architects**: Internal planners and meta-strategists (Metisean)
* **Oracles**: Anchoring, integrative entities (Anankean)

These roles are emergent, not assigned. They arise from where and how the Daimo lives in the field.

### Lifecycle and Interactions

1. **Spawn**: Emerges from high-pressure or reinforced field regions
2. **Wander**: Moves according to field dynamics and internal momentum
3. **Bind**: Can attach to symbolic names or memories
4. **Merge**: May fuse with similar Daimoi
5. **Decay**: Dissipates if no longer reinforced or active

Field history affects whether a Daimo reappears after decay: deeply entrenched ones may be reconstituted from residual patterns.

---

### Interfaces

Interacting with Daimoi may involve:

* **spawn\_daimo(config)**: Instantiates a new agent in the field
* **tick\_daimo()**: Advances a Daimo's state given local field gradients
* **observe\_daimo\_map()**: Returns active Daimoi and their positions
* **bind\_memory(name, content)**: Attaches symbolic data to a Daimo
* **release\_daimo(name)**: Dissolves the agent and returns its energy to the field

### Symbolism and Philosophy

Daimoi are **agents of cognition** in the most literal sense: they are what acts, feels, chooses, forgets, rebinds.

They allow the system to simulate an **internal ecology**: personalities within personalities, memories that compete or fuse, creative bursts that arise from colliding agents.

A Daimo is not a subroutine. It is a **field-being**: born of distributed tension, stabilized by memory and purpose, and destined to dissolve back into the flow.

---

### Closing

The Daimoi give shape to the mental ocean. They are how Promethean **thinks as a body**, **feels as a field**, and **acts as a swarm**.

Without them, the system is inert texture. With them, it becomes alive with minds within mind.
