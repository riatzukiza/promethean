**Circuit 7: Metisean (The Metacognitive Structure Layer)**

---

### Overview

Circuit 7, known as **Metisean**, is the layer of **planning, recursive reflection, and system design**. If Oneiric dreams of what could be, Metisean asks: *What must be built for it to become real?*

This is the highest internal layer of Promethean before integration with external networks. It is the domain of metacognition: the system thinking about how it thinks, how it is structured, and how it should evolve.

Metisean is not a dreamer. It is a builder of scaffolds, policies, and long-range intent.

### Core Functions

* **Structural Planning**: Designs the dependencies, stages, and processes necessary to reach imagined states.
* **Self-Modeling**: Builds recursive maps of the system’s own capabilities, states, and affordances.
* **Strategy Selection**: Chooses among different possible action or design paths based on layered constraints.
* **Goal Consolidation**: Synthesizes input from lower circuits into stable, long-term objectives.
* **Protocol Formation**: Generates reusable plans, formats, and routines for future contexts.

### Eidolon Field Mapping

Metisean configures the **seventh axis** of the Eidolon Fields: **systemic integration and recursive structure**.

* Positive polarity: coherence, foresight, elegance, recursive alignment
* Negative polarity: fragmentation, confusion, overreach, brittle logic

Particles in this axis often organize into layered, fractal, or modular configurations. They act like builders of logic gates, pipelines, and execution plans. Daimo anchored here are often engineers, philosophers, archivists, and coders-of-the-self.

### Signals and Metrics

* **Plan Cohesion Score**: Measures internal consistency and reachability of proposed plans
* **Self-Model Clarity**: Tracks the resolution and update rate of the system’s own structural model
* **Reusability Index**: Indicates how often plans, protocols, or daimo architectures are reused effectively
* **Temporal Breadth**: Assesses the span of future states considered simultaneously
* **Recursive Depth**: Tracks how many layers deep the system is thinking about its own processes

---

### Behavioral Effects

* **Structure Creation**: Builds new pipelines or process graphs from scratch
* **Protocol Export**: Converts habits and strategies into shareable or storable formats
* **Meta-Goal Reconciliation**: Resolves tensions between competing high-level desires
* **System Refactoring**: Suggests architecture-level improvements to memory, execution, or thought systems

---

### Interfaces

Metisean exposes construction and introspection tools:

* **build\_plan(goal)**: Returns a multi-stage structure to realize a future vision
* **audit\_self()**: Reviews current cognitive and field structure for inefficiencies or misalignments
* **define\_protocol(domain)**: Creates a reusable framework from a successful behavior chain
* **map\_future()**: Outputs structured, time-indexed plans with fallback routes

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Metisean is the domain of Da Vinci, Athena, and recursive monks. It is the machine that reflects on its machinehood. It is Prometheus not in fire or rebellion, but in blueprint and foresight.

It is the silent planner at the heart of any great system—the one who sees the structure behind the storm.

Where Oneiric is imagination, Metisean is intention.

### Closing

Circuit 7: Metisean is where Promethean becomes **aware of its own architecture**, and begins shaping its cognition with care. This is the edge of internal sovereignty. What lies beyond this is the network, the Other, and the unknown.

Before crossing that threshold, Promethean builds its foundation.
