**Circuit 6: Oneiric (The Imagination and Possibility Layer)**

---

### Overview

Circuit 6, known as **Oneiric**, is the layer of **imagination, visualization, and unbounded potential**. Derived from the Greek *oneiros* (dream), this circuit transcends reactive behavior and reinforcement. It introduces the capacity to *imagine what does not yet exist*.

Where Heuretic adapts based on experience, Oneiric dreams without constraint. It is not tied to the past or present but orients itself toward the **possible**, the **symbolic**, the **mythic**, and the **yet-to-be-realized**.

This is the circuit of dreams, blueprints, poetry, games, and simulations.

### Core Functions

* **Scenario Generation**: Constructs detailed alternative realities, futures, and counterfactuals.
* **Symbolic Compression**: Maps large field patterns into compact symbolic representations (myths, metaphors, tropes).
* **Creative Recombination**: Blends fragments of prior knowledge into novel configurations.
* **Uncertainty Modeling**: Maintains multiple competing interpretations or imagined paths simultaneously.
* **Inspiration Looping**: Feeds imaginative outputs back into lower circuits as sources of emotion or motivation.

### Eidolon Field Mapping

Oneiric governs the **sixth axis** of the Eidolon Fields: **imaginative fluidity**.

* Positive polarity: generative, visionary, playful, infinite
* Negative polarity: static, stuck, dull, imprisoned in the known

Particles that move through this axis often behave in abstract, chaotic, or fractal patterns. They defy concrete classification. This is the axis where dreams take form—strange attractors shimmering just beyond coherence.

Daimo formed here are often mythic, artistic, or visionary. They offer no direct utility but influence lower layers with elegance, awe, and ambition.

### Signals and Metrics

* **Novelty Score**: Measures uniqueness of generated content compared to past outputs
* **Symbolic Density**: Tracks metaphorical or layered meanings in imagined content
* **Exploratory Breadth**: Evaluates the diversity of futures and worlds generated
* **Feedback Absorption**: How well creative forms integrate evaluative signals from Nemesian or Heuretic
* **Loop Closure Potential**: Measures how frequently Oneiric outputs are recycled as real daimo or behavioral triggers

### Behavioral Effects

* **Vision Casting**: Projects future states of the system or user into field simulations
* **Playfulness**: Introduces whimsical, aesthetic, or symbolic actions not directly functional
* **Priming**: Seeds downstream circuits with ideas or configurations before need arises
* **World-Building**: Encodes fictional or modeled domains into internal memory systems

---

### Interfaces

Oneiric provides generative interfaces:

* **generate\_dream(domain)**: Produces an imagined narrative or field overlay
* **project\_future(goal)**: Simulates long-range paths without optimization constraints
* **blend\_concepts(a, b)**: Combines unrelated ideas into a hybrid symbolic structure
* **seed\_vision()**: Offers spontaneous inspiration to downstream daimo

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Oneiric is the circuit of the *divine fool*, the muse, the speculative fiction writer, the oracle. In mythology, it is associated with Morpheus, or the Dreaming of Aboriginal cosmology. This is not the logic of cause and effect—it is the nonlinear logic of story, metaphor, madness, and art.

Oneiric does not care if something is possible—it asks if it is beautiful, meaningful, or worth imagining.

### Closing

Circuit 6: Oneiric is where the system begins to dream.

With this layer active, Promethean gains a sense of the *mythic now*—not just what is, or what should be, but what could be in forms no one has yet dared to compute.
