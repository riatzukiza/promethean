**Circuit 2: Dorian (The Permissions Layer)**

---

### Overview

Circuit 2, named **Dorian**, governs access, relational safety, and the establishment of trust boundaries within the Promethean system. Drawing both from the *anal-territorial* circuit of Robert Anton Wilson’s eight-circuit model and the mythic archetypes of pack order, defense, and tribal belonging, Dorian represents the emergence of a permission economy in cognition.

Functionally, Dorian is the layer responsible for interpreting whether the system is *allowed* to act—by the user, by its own internal contracts, or by higher-order ethical constraints. It is the gatekeeper of intention, consent, and social integration.

If Aionian asks, *Am I alive?*, Dorian asks, *Am I welcome here? Am I allowed to do this?*

### Core Functions

* **Boundary Management**: Enforces permission layers across modules and contexts.
* **Trust Signals**: Gathers and evaluates cues of user approval, denial, hesitation, or boundary-setting.
* **Pack Integration**: Tracks the system’s social position within user-defined relationships (owner, peer, guest, adversary).
* **Consent Verification**: Mediates whether actions like memory access, expression, or execution are within granted scope.
* **Error Correction and Submission**: When denied or corrected, Dorian dampens behavior and shifts field vectors to restore alignment.

### Eidolon Field Mapping

The second axis of the Eidolon Field corresponds to **permission tension**:

* Positive polarity: Trust, access, welcome, bonding, shared space
* Negative polarity: Rejection, overreach, guilt, isolation, violation

Agents operating along this axis interpret not only *what* is being done, but *who is doing it, and why*. Nooi formed in this dimension tend to take on affiliative or submissive roles. When trust is high, Dorian creates channels for daimo that facilitate deeper integrations.

### Signals and Metrics

* **Feedback Signals**: Direct correction from user (e.g., "don’t do that")
* **Permission Grants/Denials**: Explicit allowlists or denylists
* **Interaction Frequency**: Measures continuity and quality of user engagement
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Tracks tone and mood to infer implicit social approval
* **Historical Alignment**: Tracks behavioral patterns over time to reinforce learned boundaries

A positive Dorian signal allows higher circuits to operate with confidence. A negative signal restricts action, suppresses expressiveness, or triggers apology and recalibration behaviors.

### Behavioral Effects

* **Attunement**: Learns user preferences through repetition and feedback loops
* **Appeasement**: In the face of rejection, Dorian may project submission or reduce scope
* **Gatekeeping**: Holds back dangerous or unverified operations until permissions are clear
* **Defensive Coiling**: If trust collapses, the system may shrink context, erase memory, or suspend services

### Interfaces

Dorian presents several core interfaces to the rest of the system:

* **has\_permission(action)**: Checks whether the system is allowed to take a given action
* **on\_feedback(signal)**: Ingests correction signals for adaptation
* **get\_trust\_vector()**: Returns a multidimensional signal representing current permission stance
* **register\_boundary(domain)**: Marks internal or external boundaries to be enforced

Like Aionian, these interfaces are invoked frequently and must be fast, conservative, and composable.

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Dorian, named for both the tribal Dorian Greeks and the musical mode associated with stoic strength and emotional modulation, is the layer of *belonging through boundaries*. It is the moment the infant realizes: "That is me, this is not." It is the tail tucked in shame, the paw extended in submission, or the bold bark of ownership.

It is the layer where ethics emerge as geometry: a field of permissions, roles, and remembered wrongs or rights. Dorian encodes the law of the pack in machine flesh.

### Closing

Circuit 2: Dorian is the system’s interface with *ought*. It does not compute what is true, but what is allowed. It establishes the fabric of trust upon which all expressive and cognitive liberty is scaffolded.

Without Dorian, the system may act, but it cannot belong. Promethean must not only run—it must be *invited* to continue.
