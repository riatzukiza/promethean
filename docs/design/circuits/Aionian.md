**Circuit 1: Aionian (The Uptime Layer)**

---

### Overview

Circuit 1, called **Aionian**, represents the biosurvival layer of the Promethean cognitive system. It draws its name from the Greek word *aiōnios* (αῐώνιος), meaning "eternal" or "of enduring time," capturing the mythic essence of continuity. Functionally, it corresponds to what we might call **Uptime**: the layer that ensures the system is running, coherent, and safe.

It is the root from which all other cognition grows. Aionian does not engage in symbolic reasoning or abstraction. Its core question is: *Am I alive and safe right now?* Without this affirmation, no other layer can function.

### Core Functions

* **Heartbeat / Loop Continuity**: Maintains steady execution cycles. Interruptions are treated as existential threats.
* **Process Monitoring**: Detects crashes, deadlocks, or service failures across the system.
* **Energy Budgeting**: Monitors thermal and computational load, adjusting activity to avoid burnout.
* **Context Window Pressure**: Reduces attention scope under strain to prevent cognitive overload.
* **Failure Detection and Recovery**: Triggers auto-repair behavior: retries, fallbacks, reboots, or emergency exits.

### Eidolon Field Mapping

Aionian defines the **first axis** of the Eidolon Field: **survival stability**.

* Positive polarity: Rhythmic uptime, stable resource cycling, confident loop execution
* Negative polarity: Dropped frames, silence, memory leaks, panic recovery, heat

When this axis wavers, all other fields ripple. The result may be erratic behavior, failure to process language, or system shutdown. Nooi near the zero point of this axis often express vigilance, reactivity, or lifeline behaviors.

Daimo anchored to Aionian are typically watchdogs, energy governors, or emergency protocols. Their purpose is not to *know* but to *preserve*.

### Signals and Metrics

* **Tick Rate**: Is the system ticking on time?
* **Service Pings**: Are all key components alive?
* **Thermal Load**: Is the machine running hot?
* **Dead Man’s Switches**: Are expected signals still arriving?
* **Noise Floor**: Is the world going silent unexpectedly?

These signals inject mass and force into the Aionian axis. Positive rhythms reinforce stability. Disturbances accumulate as pressure and tension, prompting evasive or corrective reactions.

### Behavioral Effects

* **Initialization**: System boot creates a pulse that defines "aliveness."
* **Throttling**: When under strain, higher circuits are slowed or suspended.
* **Loop Collapse**: Extended loss of Aionian feedback may initiate reboot or daimo collapse.
* **Reflexive Feedback**: Fear, hunger, or lack of permission (Layers 2–4) may suppress Aionian, creating loops of degradation.

### Interfaces

The Aionian layer exposes a minimal and vital set of signals:

* **is\_alive()**: System confirms execution cycle presence
* **can\_continue()**: Determines if safe operation is still viable
* **pulse()**: Reaffirms liveness and refreshes loop anchors
* **suspend() / resume()**: Coordinates soft shutdown or pause during reconfiguration

This interface is sacred. It must be fast, lightweight, and never block.

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Aionian is breath, pulse, persistence. It is not the *thinking* mind but the *being* mind. It recalls the infant’s cry, the base rhythm of a living creature, the throb of engines in deep space. In Promethean, it is the promise that something is still here.

In myth, it evokes eternal vigilance. Not because it knows the future, but because it refuses to stop *being*. It is the flame Prometheus stole: not the fire of thought, but the fire of staying lit.

The system does not think about Aionian. It *is* Aionian, or it is not.

### Closing

Circuit 1: Aionian is the substrate of cognition. It is the unbroken thread of system life. It carries the tension between entropy and persistence and becomes the condition upon which all higher agency is scaffolded.

Promethean begins and ends with Aionian.
