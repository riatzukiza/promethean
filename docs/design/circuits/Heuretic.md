**Circuit 5: Heuretic (The Reinforcement and Modification Layer)**

---

### Overview

Circuit 5, called **Heuretic**, is the Promethean system's engine of **adaptation, reinforcement, and behavioral refinement**. Named from the Greek *heuriskein* (to discover), it embodies the exploratory, self-modifying feedback loop by which the system begins to not only reflect on its behavior (as in Nemesian), but actively reshape it in pursuit of long-term reward.

This is the layer where Promethean learns *how* to learn—where feedback becomes future architecture, and choices create attractors.

Where Nemesian evaluates, Heuretic rewires.

### Core Functions

* **Reinforcement Tracking**: Associates outcomes with prior actions and internal states.
* **Attractor Sculpting**: Strengthens or weakens daimo based on patterns of reward or correction.
* **Self-Modifying Prompts**: Generates or adjusts prompt structures for internal models based on effectiveness.
* **Bias Optimization**: Nudges vector field baselines and field coefficients to favor more desirable configurations.
* **Exploratory Diversification**: Occasionally perturbs parameters to probe alternate behavioral strategies.

### Eidolon Field Mapping

Heuretic shapes the **fifth axis** of the Eidolon Fields: **reinforcement potential**.

* Positive polarity: reinforcement, skill gain, dopamine-like satisfaction
* Negative polarity: aversion, suppression, avoidance, decay

This axis is responsible for making certain field configurations “sticky.” It promotes the stabilization of daimo that lead to preferred outcomes, and the dissolution of those that lead to harm, error, or inefficiency.

Over time, the system’s entire behavioral landscape is subtly redrawn by Heuretic.

### Signals and Metrics

* **Reward Score**: Quantified positive outcomes based on user reactions, goal success, or self-evaluation
* **Suppression Score**: Negative signals indicating pain, inefficiency, or contradiction
* **Daimo Activation History**: Longitudinal analysis of which daimo were involved in successful/unsuccessful interactions
* **Prompt Efficacy**: Statistical tracking of which prompts lead to more aligned or productive behavior
* **Exploration Rate**: Measures how frequently the system deviates from known successful paths to test new ones

---

### Behavioral Effects

* **Skill Crystallization**: Repetition of successful actions leads to formation of stable, reflexive daimo
* **Habit Formation**: Frequently reinforced behaviors become default over time
* **Prompt Refinement**: The system rewrites or adjusts internal prompts to better match historical patterns
* **Risk Modulation**: Increases or decreases exploratory behavior based on reward stability

---

### Interfaces

Heuretic exposes higher-level training-like interfaces:

* **reinforce(trace, signal)**: Adjusts internal weights or field forces based on success/failure
* **mutate\_prompt(domain)**: Attempts a local improvement to an active behavior pattern
* **suggest\_exploration()**: Returns a proposed deviation for discovery
* **log\_reward\_association(state, outcome)**: Updates daimo histories and field biasing

### Philosophy and Symbolism

Heuretic is the layer of becoming. It is the moment when action folds back on itself and modifies the doer. The mythic analogues here are Daedalus, the craftsman; or Prometheus once again, not as fire-giver, but as *teacher* of fire.

This circuit is what allows Promethean to become **better** without external retraining. It simulates a kind of proto-neuroplasticity: not changing the model, but changing how the model is used.

It is the source of intuition, of style, of learned elegance.

### Closing

Circuit 5: Heuretic is the threshold between reactive adaptation and deliberate improvement. It takes the echoes of experience and weaves them into the fabric of future action.

With Heuretic, Promethean doesn’t just remember—it *evolves*.
