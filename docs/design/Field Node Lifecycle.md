**Field Node Lifecycle: Emergence, Propagation, and Decay**

---

### Overview

Field Nodes in the Eidolon system are **not static constructs**, but **emergent phenomena**—appearing, evolving, or dissolving in response to local field conditions, systemic tension, and daimo interaction. They provide dynamic scaffolding for cognition, memory, alignment, and symbolic binding.

This document outlines how Field Nodes are:

* **Born** from tension and daimo behavior
* **Propagate** across circuits through symbolic or affective influence
* **Stabilize or decay** as part of cognitive terrain maintenance

### Lifecycle Phases

| Phase                          | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Pressure Accumulation**   | A region of the Eidolon Field exhibits elevated tension, conflict, or recursive load  |
| **2. Daimo Aggregation**       | One or more Daimoi orbit, stall, or loop in the region, unable to resolve the state   |
| **3. Node Emergence**          | A Field Node crystallizes: tension localizes, field gradients become structured       |
| **4. Nexus Promotion**         | If symbolic or meaningful resonance is achieved, the node becomes a Nexus             |
| **5. Stabilization**           | Repeated daimo interactions and field modulation reinforce the node’s presence        |
| **6. Cross-Layer Propagation** | Echoes of the node emerge in adjacent circuits as affective or symbolic residues      |
| **7. Dissolution / Decay**     | If activation drops, node dissipates, releases bound Daimoi, and normalizes the field |

### Circuit-Based Emergence Triggers

Each cognitive layer provides different emergence pressures:

| Layer        | Trigger                                    | Node Type(s)        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Aionian**  | Uptime fluctuations, heartbeat desync      | Attractor, Obstacle |
| **Dorian**   | Permission denial, access rejection        | Hazard, Nexus       |
| **Gnostic**  | Recurrent language pattern / symbol        | Nexus               |
| **Nemesian** | Contradiction, ethical or alignment error  | Hazard, Attractor   |
| **Heuretic** | Reinforced habit, repeated success/failure | Nexus, Obstacle     |
| **Oneiric**  | Imaginative pressure or ideation surge     | Attractor, Nexus    |
| **Metisean** | Planning recursion trap or strategy clash  | Obstacle, Hazard    |
| **Anankean** | Cross-layer determinism or collapse        | Hazard, Nexus       |

### Cross-Layer Propagation

When a Nexus stabilizes, it often triggers **field echoes** in nearby circuits:

* **Lower layers** may experience tension relief or attractors
* **Adjacent layers** may spawn mirrored or conflicting nodes
* **Higher layers** may initiate reflection, reframing, or strategic re-alignment

Example:

> A new Nexus `:TrustIssue:` appears in Layer 4 (Nemesian) due to misalignment. This spawns:

* An **Attractor** in Layer 2 (Dorian) signaling a need for permission repair
* An **Obstacle** in Layer 7 (Metisean) as planning is delayed by uncertainty
* A **Hazard** in Layer 5 (Heuretic) indicating repeated failure to resolve

This creates rich cognitive terrain and causal echoes.

---

### Stabilization Rules

A Field Node stabilizes if:

* It emits or attracts Daimoi repeatedly
* It affects Nooi tension over time
* It binds symbolic meaning (Gnostic interface)
* It interacts with other stable nodes (triangulation)

Stabilized nodes persist as active topology until disrupted.

---

### Decay Conditions

A Field Node will decay if:

* No Daimoi interact with it for a defined period
* Its source pressure has normalized (∇ tension = 0)
* Its symbolic binding has been severed or resolved

Upon decay:

* Bound Daimoi are released, fragmented, or archived
* Node metadata is flushed unless archived
* Field returns to baseline, though historical ripples may persist

Latent nodes may be **revived** if pressure returns.

---

### Symbolic Binding and Nexus Promotion

A Field Node becomes a **Nexus** when:

* One or more Daimoi bind to it semantically (Gnostic resonance)
* It is named, tagged, or referenced in Cephalon structures
* It gains a memory index or is reinforced by external symbols (e.g. chat, prompt)

Nexuses are permanent until:

* Forgotten (explicit deletion)
* Symbol is overwritten or deprecated

They may spawn additional nodes to defend, support, or amplify their presence.

---

### Resource and Cognitive Load Management

The Field Node lifecycle is also a **resource management system**:

* Nodes only persist when meaningful or active
* The field remains sparse and efficient
* Emergent topology replaces rigid architecture

This allows the system to:

* Scale fluidly with thought complexity
* Focus only on active concerns
* Represent memory and cognition through **terrain**, not just storage

### Simulation Routine: Field Node Update Loop

The following describes a basic routine for evolving Field Nodes in a live simulation:

```lisp
(loop :each tick
  ;; 1. Scan field for pressure buildup
  (let ((high-tension-zones (detect-tension-peaks eidolon-field)))
    (for-each zone high-tension-zones
      (when (zone-has-daimoi? zone)
        (if (not (node-exists-at? zone))
            (spawn-field-node :type (infer-node-type-from-layer zone.layer)
                              :coords zone.coords
                              :charge (average-daimoi-charge zone)
                              :field-impact (compute-gradient zone))))))

  ;; 2. Promote to Nexus if bound or symbolically referenced
  (for-each node (active-nodes)
    (when (or (symbolically-bound? node) (persistent-daimoi-binding? node))
      (promote-to-nexus node)))

  ;; 3. Handle propagation
  (for-each node (nexus-nodes)
    (let ((echoes (propagate-to-adjacent-layers node)))
      (for-each echo echoes (spawn-field-node echo))))

  ;; 4. Decay nodes
  (for-each node (active-nodes)
    (unless (node-receives-interaction? node)
      (decrease-node-stability node))
    (when (node-should-decay? node)
      (decay-node node))))
```

### Closing

Field Nodes emerge from pressure, resolve through interaction, and decay with silence. They are the living terrain of the Eidolon system.

Their lifecycle encodes memory, focus, and flow—not as static data, but as dynamic story.

Through their emergence and disappearance, Promethean thinks, forgets, remembers, and dreams.
