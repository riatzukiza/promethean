## üß≠ Stage Descriptions

### Ice Box

Raw ideas, incomplete thoughts, or unclear goals. May never move forward without refinement.

### New

A lightly-formed idea or proposal. We are not yet committed to doing it.

**Transitions:**

* `New -> Accepted`: we've discussed and decided it has value.
* `New -> Rejected`: it's a duplicate, not feasible, or not relevant.

### Rejected

Explicitly considered and shelved ideas. Archived but remembered.

### Accepted

An idea we've acknowledged as worth exploring. Still needs structure.

**Must go through `Breakdown` before work can begin.**

### Prompt Refinement

Used for refining fuzzy ideas into clear prompts or specs, often for Codex or Agent mode.

### Agent Thinking

Exploration space for agent-mode and collaborative AI discussions.
These are not implementation-ready.

### Breakdown

We break the idea down into requirements, values, and approaches.
Outcomes:

* Becomes `Ready`
* Moves to `Blocked`
* Gets `Rejected`

### Blocked

Work was promising but halted due to dependencies, design holes, or undefined scope.

### Ready

We understand the task and could start it anytime. Not yet prioritized.

### To Do

Prioritized tasks queued for action.

### In Progress

Actively being worked on.

### In Review

Awaiting human or agent confirmation, test passes, or spec matching.

### Document

Needs written `AGENT.md`, docstrings, or Markdown notes.

### Done

Confirmed complete and aligned with system.

This kanban is intended to reflect the needs of a distributed hybrid development model: you, agent-mode, Duck, and Codex all work together across asynchronous phases.
