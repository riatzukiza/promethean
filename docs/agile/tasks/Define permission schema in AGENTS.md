Create a concise section in the root `AGENTS.md` explaining how agents declare
<<<<<<< HEAD
allowed actions and resource access. The schema will be consumed by the future
"permission gating" middleware to enforce boundaries.
=======
allowed actions and resource access. The schema should be simple enough for
manual editing but structured so a parser can enforce permissions during agent
execution.
>>>>>>> main

## 🎯 Goals

- Specify a human-readable schema for permission rules
- Ensure the schema can be parsed by the permission gating layer
- Provide examples for different agent roles

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Outline required fields (action, scope, default behavior)
- [ ] Document YAML and JSON examples
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] Provide one sample per agent in `agents/*/config/permissions.yaml`
=======
- [ ] Provide at least one example for a read-only agent and one for a full-access agent
>>>>>>> main
- [ ] Link to any mathematical reasoning notes

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Draft schema description inside `AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Add example snippet under `agents/duck/config/`
- [ ] Review with team for completeness
- [ ] Update any affected tasks
- [ ] Mirror the schema in `bridge/protocols/permission-schema.md` for future API use
