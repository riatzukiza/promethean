## 🛠️ Task: Add unit tests for date_tools.py

Write pytest tests covering functions in `shared/py/date_tools.py`.
The module now exposes a helper called `days_until` for measuring the
difference in days between two datetimes. Tests should cover this
function alongside `time_ago`.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Achieve at least 90% coverage for this module
- Ensure edge cases for `time_ago` and related utilities are tested

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] Use pytest with clear assertions
- [ ] Include small datetime fixtures

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Test `time_ago` relative formatting
- [ ] Test `days_until` calculation
