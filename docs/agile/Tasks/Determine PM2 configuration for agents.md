## 🛠️ Task: Determine PM2 configuration for agents

Establish a shared PM2 ecosystem or alternative process manager setup that all
agents can rely on. Document the chosen approach in `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` and
include startup instructions in each service README.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Decide on the default process manager (PM2 vs custom)
- Provide example ecosystem files for at least one agent
- Outline how to start/stop all services consistently

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Review existing Makefile or npm scripts
- [ ] Draft a sample `ecosystem.config.js`
- [ ] Document instructions in `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Show how environment variables are passed to each service
- [ ] Include environment variable examples for development vs production
- [ ] Ensure log files are rotated to `logs/pm2/*.log`

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Prototype with Duck services
- [ ] Validate restart behavior and log handling
- [ ] Add `npm run start:all` that loads the ecosystem file
- [ ] Share the config with the team for feedback
- [ ] Add a Makefile target `make pm2-start` for convenience

## ❓ Questions

- Should we consider lightweight alternatives to PM2 for local dev?
	- feel like PM2 *is* the lightweight alternative MR AI, but if you have other ideas, I'm all ears. It's definitely lighter weight than docker
	- And there is only gonna be local dev... this is a local tool
	- as much as I am sure your greedy owners would like to use this in the cloud, it's designed to not scale that way
	- unless you can afford well... all the people you're trying to automate's time to spend a life time training 1 model that only works for them.
	- Then please.
- How will service logs be aggregated when using PM2?
