## 🛠️ Task: Mirror shared utils with language-specific doc folders

Create documentation folders that mirror the utilities in `shared/`, grouped by their implementation language. This will make it easier to reference cross-language helpers in the design docs.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Align documentation structure with the `shared/` directory
- Provide examples for Python, Hy, and Sibilant/JS utilities
- Improve discoverability of common helper functions

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Audit `shared/` to list existing utility modules
- [ ] Create matching folders under `docs/shared/` for each language
- [ ] Generate README stubs summarizing available utilities

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Draft initial README for Python utilities
- [ ] Draft initial README for Sibilant/JS utilities
- [ ] Link these docs from `docs/file-structure.md`
