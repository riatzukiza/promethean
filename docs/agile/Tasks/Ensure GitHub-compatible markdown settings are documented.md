## 🛠️ Task: Ensure GitHub-compatible markdown settings are documented

Some Obsidian features don't render well on GitHub. We need clear guidelines so contributors produce markdown that looks correct both locally and on GitHub.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Document the vault settings that affect GitHub rendering
- Explain how to convert wikilinks to standard links
- Provide formatting tips (line breaks, code fences, etc.)

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [x] Add a section to `vault-config/README.md` describing recommended settings
- [x] Mention any plugins used to export or format markdown
- [ ] Include Prettier or markdownlint configuration if applicable

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [x] Review current Obsidian settings
- [x] Summarize options that influence markdown syntax
- [x] Update documentation and link from `AGENTS.md`
