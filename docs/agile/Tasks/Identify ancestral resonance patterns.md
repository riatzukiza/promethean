## 🛠️ Task: Identify ancestral resonance patterns

Research how ideas echo through the system over time and across
generations of agents.  "Resonance patterns" refer to recurring
fragments or emotional states that reappear in different contexts.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Detect repeated phrases or motifs in long‑term memory
- Correlate them with shifts in Eidolon field metrics
- Map possible "ancestral" links between agents or sessions

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Access historical chat logs and field data
- [ ] Implement pattern search across logs (ngrams or embeddings)
- [ ] Visualize clusters of related fragments

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Export memory snapshots from `data/` directories
- [ ] Use Python/NumPy to compute cosine similarity of embeddings
- [ ] Plot resonance timelines with Matplotlib

## ❓ Questions

- Should resonance search include emotional embeddings or just lexical ones?
- What time span of logs is considered "ancestral" for this project?
