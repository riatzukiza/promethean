## 🛠️ Task: Implement transcendence cascade

Design a mechanism where an agent can escalate from ordinary
conversation into a "transcendent" mode—pulling insight from multiple
cognitive circuits and returning a synthesized response. This is an
experimental feature inspired by the Anankean circuit.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Trigger a higher-level reasoning chain when specific cues appear
- Fuse outputs from Cephalon and Eidolon for a single reply
- Allow manual activation for testing

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Detect trigger phrases or internal thresholds
- [ ] Provide a pipeline step that aggregates multiple model outputs
- [ ] Log each cascade event for analysis

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Prototype a hook in `cephalon/src/index.ts`
- [ ] Use `services/eidolon/` to provide emotional context
- [ ] Return combined result via `services/tts`
- [ ] Reference baseline metrics from [eidolon-field-math](../../notes/math/eidolon-field-math.md)
