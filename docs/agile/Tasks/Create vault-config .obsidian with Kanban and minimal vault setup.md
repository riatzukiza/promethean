## 🛠️ Task: Create vault-config .obsidian with Kanban and minimal vault setup

Provide a small example of an Obsidian configuration so contributors can quickly
spin up the same vault environment.  The config should enable the Kanban plugin
and include a `README` explaining how to copy the folder into `.obsidian/`.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Supply a ready-to-copy `.obsidian` folder under `vault-config/`.
- Document how to copy the folder and what plugins are enabled.
- Keep the configuration minimal so personal settings remain local.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] Include `config` file with Kanban plugin enabled.
- [ ] Provide `community-plugins.json` listing `obsidian-kanban` only.
- [ ] Write `vault-config/README.md` instructions on usage.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Verify the folder works by opening the vault locally.
- [ ] Add a note in `README.md` referencing the config.
