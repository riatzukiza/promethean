## 🛠️ Task: Create vault-config .obsidian with Kanban and minimal vault setup

<<<<<<< HEAD
Provide a shareable `.obsidian` folder that new contributors can copy to get the
same Kanban board and plugin configuration. Keep the config minimal so it works
across different operating systems.
=======
Provide a small example of an Obsidian configuration so contributors can quickly
spin up the same vault environment. The config should enable the Kanban plugin
and include a `README` explaining how to copy the folder into `.obsidian/`.

=======
- Supply a ready-to-copy `.obsidian` folder under `vault-config/`.
