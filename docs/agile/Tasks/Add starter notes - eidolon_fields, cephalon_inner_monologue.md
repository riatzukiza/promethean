## 🛠️ Task: Add starter notes - eidolon_fields, cephalon_inner_monologue

Write introductory documentation for two core concepts: **eidolon_fields** and
**cephalon_inner_monologue**.  These notes will serve as a reference for future
implementation work in the Eidolon and Cephalon services.  Place the notes in
`docs/notes/` so they are available to the vault and link them from the
`docs/unique/index.md` file.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a high level description of what **eidolon_fields** represent and how
  they influence emotional state.
- Document the purpose of **cephalon_inner_monologue** and how it interacts with
  the Eidolon field during agent reasoning.
- Establish a canonical location in `docs/notes/` for further deep dives.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] Create `docs/notes/eidolon_fields.md` with an overview section and bullet
      list of key properties.
- [ ] Create `docs/notes/cephalon_inner_monologue.md` describing the monologue
      loop and its inputs/outputs.
- [ ] Link both notes from `docs/unique/index.md` so they appear in the
      knowledge base.
- [ ] Keep each note under 2 pages of markdown with clear headings.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Draft each note in the vault using [[wikilinks]] for related concepts.
- [ ] Convert wikilinks to standard markdown before committing.
