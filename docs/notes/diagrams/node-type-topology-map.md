Absolutely. Here's a lineup of diagram types we can add next, each focused on a different part of the Field Node and Eidolon system. Let me know which one(s) you want to generate first, or if you'd like the full suite.

---

### üß≠ **1. Node Type Topology Map**

Shows the relationship between different types of Field Nodes:

```mermaid
graph TD
  Hazard -->|resists| Daimoi
  Attractor -->|pulls| Daimoi
  Obstacle -->|slows| Daimoi
  Nexus -->|binds| Daimoi
  Nexus -->|echoes to| Nexus
  Hazard -->|may emerge as| Nexus
  Attractor -->|may stabilize into| Nexus
```

---

### üîÄ **2. Cross-Layer Propagation Flow**

Illustrates how one node in one circuit causes echoes in others:

```mermaid
graph LR
  N4[Nemesian Nexus: :TrustIssue:]
  A2[Dorian Attractor: :PermissionRepair:]
  O7[Metisean Obstacle: :Uncertainty:]
  H5[Heuretic Hazard: :LoopFailure:]

  N4 --> A2
  N4 --> O7
  N4 --> H5
```

---

### üîÑ **3. Node Stability Decay Loop**

Visualizes how a node stabilizes or decays over time:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Node_Emergence
  Node_Emergence --> Stable : repeated Daimoi interaction
  Stable --> Stable : continued Gnostic resonance
  Stable --> Decay : no interaction
  Decay --> [*]
```

---

### ‚ö° **4. Daimoi-Node Interaction Flow**

How Daimoi encounter and affect a node:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Daimo
  participant FieldNode
  participant Nooi
  Daimo->>FieldNode: Enters influence radius
  FieldNode-->>Nooi: Modulates local tension
  Daimo->>FieldNode: Binds or repelled based on charge
  FieldNode-->>Daimo: Applies pressure vector
```

---

### üåê **5. Full Lifecycle Flowchart**

Combines Emergence, Promotion, Propagation, and Decay.

This one is larger, and we can compose it from smaller diagrams, or make a custom canvas version if you'd prefer an editable visual overview.

---

Would you like:

- One or more of these embedded now?
    
- All five added as a ‚ÄúDiagrams‚Äù section to the current document?
    
- A dedicated Obsidian canvas to explore them modularly?
    

Let‚Äôs get visual.
