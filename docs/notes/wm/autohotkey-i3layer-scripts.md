This note sketches an AutoHotkey script (`i3layer.ahk`) that mirrors i3wm behavior on Windows. It details keybindings for focusing windows, moving them, launching terminals, and cycling through groups via a Node-based group manager. The design mimics i3's mod key workflow, providing a tiling-like environment.
