Trying to recall a Lisp dialect used in an academic setting: it wasn't Hy or Julia, but had tight Python interop and was paired with Cython for performance. Possibilities include Racket forks or internal DSLs like Starlark or other ephemeral teaching tools. Recreating such a Lisp would involve translating S-expressions to Python AST and compiling with Cython.
