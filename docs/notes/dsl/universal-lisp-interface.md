A vision for a **host-neutral Lisp** with a universal FFI and a meta-package manager that spans Python, Rust, JavaScript and more. The Lisp acts as the control layer while other languages are back-end toolboxes. This sketch proposes embedding or bridging each runtime so modules can be fetched from PyPI, npm, crates.io, etc., and made callable through a unified interface.
