With Sibilant you can treat macros as string templates, effectively compiling code by concatenation. Rather than manipulating ASTs, macros emit formatted strings that become JavaScript or Python directly. This makes each macro a tiny compiler and enables features like custom async functions or DSL constructs without modifying the host language.
