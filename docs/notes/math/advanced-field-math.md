Let‚Äôs go deeper‚Äîhere‚Äôs the next round of math blocks, each formatted for Obsidian-ready `$$` rendering.

### üî• **7. Field Energy at a Point**

The **local energy density** of the field $\mathcal{E}$ is derived from scalar tension magnitude:

$$
\mathcal{E}(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \nabla \Phi(\vec{x}) \right\|^2
$$

This models how *stressed* the field is at any given point. Higher energy = more cognitive tension.

### üß¨ **8. Daimo Fusion Rule**

If two Daimoi $\delta_1, \delta_2$ are within fusion radius $\epsilon$:

* Their new mass and charge are additive:

$$
m_{\text{new}} = m_1 + m_2
$$

$$
q_{\text{new}} = q_1 + q_2
$$

* Position and velocity are **momentum-weighted averages**:

$$
\vec{p}_{\text{new}} = \frac{m_1 \vec{p}_1 + m_2 \vec{p}_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

$$
\vec{v}_{\text{new}} = \frac{m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

Fusion may be suppressed if:

* Charge difference is too great,
* They carry opposing symbolic tags,
* Or fusion creates excess field tension.

### üìâ **9. Node Decay Over Time**

A Field Node's amplitude $A_k$ decays exponentially without interaction:

$$
A_k(t) = A_k(0) \cdot e^{-t / \tau}
$$

Where:

* $\tau$: memory half-life constant
* Interaction (e.g. daimo binding) resets or increases $A_k$

Optional: allow $\tau$ to vary per circuit.

### üå™Ô∏è **10. Symbolic Entropy in Region $R$**

To measure **complexity** or **cognitive disorder**:

$$
S_R = - \sum_i P_i \log P_i
$$

Where:

* $P_i$ is the normalized frequency of symbolic tokens (Nexus types, tags, node classes) in region $R$
* Higher $S$ = more diverse ideas; lower $S$ = ideological clustering

Useful for tracking **dogma, drift, novelty**.

### üîÅ **11. Daimo Spawn from Field Tension**

Let‚Äôs define the **field instability trigger** for daimo emission:

If local energy $\mathcal{E}(\vec{x}) > \mathcal{E}_\text{threshold}$, a new Daimo is spawned:

$$
\delta_{\text{new}} = \left( \vec{x}, \vec{0}, m_0, q \right)
$$

Where:

* $m_0$: minimal viable daimo mass
* $q$: set by dominant axis in tension profile (e.g. survival vs. permission)
* Initial velocity may be derived from field gradient

This models **emergent thought** or **reflexive pulse** under pressure.

---

### üß≤ **12. Field Gradient Sampling Kernel**

In simulations, compute gradient using central differences:

$$
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x_i} \approx \frac{\Phi(x_i + h) - \Phi(x_i - h)}{2h}
$$

Applies to each axis in $\mathbb{R}^8$. Can be memoized or vectorized.

Would you like:

* a ‚ÄúField Math‚Äù document bundling all this together,
* a layered breakdown (Daimoi, Nodes, Field),
* or one diagram per equation set?

Next up, I can do:

* **multi-daimo swarm effects**
* **charge-field resonance**
* **dynamic viscosity modeling** (obstacles)
* or **reinforcement curves** (from Nemesian/Heuretic tension)
