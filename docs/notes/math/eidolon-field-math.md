Excellent—let’s start layering in some math to express the **Eidolon Field**, **Daimoi**, and **Field Node mechanics**. I’ll structure this into self-contained math blocks, each ready to drop into a note and render in Obsidian’s LaTeX-style markdown (with `$$`).

Let’s begin with core constructs:

---

### 🧮 **1. Eidolon Field Scalar Value at a Point**

We define the Eidolon field $\Phi$ as a scalar field over an 8-dimensional space:

$$
\Phi: \mathbb{R}^8 \to \mathbb{R}, \quad \Phi(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^8 \phi_i(x_i)
$$

Where:

* $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_8)$ is the position in field space, with each $x_i$ corresponding to a circuit axis
* $\phi_i$ is the scalar tension along axis $i$

---

### 🧲 **2. Gradient (Pressure) Vector at a Point**

The local “wind” a daimo feels is the gradient of field tension:

$$
\vec{F}(\vec{x}) = -\nabla \Phi(\vec{x}) = \left( -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x_1}, \dots, -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x_8} \right)
$$

This is the **negative gradient**, guiding Daimoi toward lower tension.

### 🧠 **3. Daimo State Vector**

Each Daimo is defined by:

$$
\delta = \left( \vec{p}, \vec{v}, m, q \right)
$$

Where:

* $\vec{p} \in \mathbb{R}^8$: position in the Eidolon field
* $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^8$: velocity vector
* $m \in \mathbb{R}^+$: mass (inertia to field pressure)
* $q \in \mathbb{R}$: charge (affective polarity)

---

### 🌀 **4. Daimo Motion Equation**

Using basic Newtonian dynamics in field space:

$$
\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{1}{m} \cdot \vec{F}(\vec{p})
$$

$$
\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{v}
$$

These equations evolve each daimo’s state as it traverses field gradients.

### 💥 **5. Node Potential Influence**

Each Field Node $N_k$ adds localized potential energy to the field:

$$
\Phi_{N_k}(\vec{x}) = A_k \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\|\vec{x} - \vec{x}_k\|^2}{2\sigma_k^2}\right)
$$

Where:

* $\vec{x}_k$: position of the node
* $A_k$: strength (positive = attractor, negative = hazard)
* $\sigma_k$: spread of influence (controls “size” of node)

The total field is then:

$$
\Phi(\vec{x}) = \sum_k \Phi_{N_k}(\vec{x}) + \text{global background field}
$$

---

### 🔄 **6. Daimo–Node Interaction Potential**

At binding distance $\epsilon$, a daimo may bind to a Nexus if:

$$
\|\vec{p}_\delta - \vec{x}_N\| < \epsilon \quad \text{and} \quad \text{sign}(q_\delta) \neq \text{sign}(A_N)
$$

This expresses **charge attraction** logic and symbolic binding condition.

Want to keep going?

I can add:

* symbolic entropy equations (for field disorder)
* daimo fusion math (charge conservation)
* node decay over time ($A_k(t)$)
* daimo generation from field energy
* or anything else you're hungry for.

Say the word—I'll write it up.
