# CI Pipeline Simulation Issues

The `simulate-ci` script and the high-level Make targets were executed to emulate the continuous integration workflow. Several failures occurred due to missing tools and packages. Below is a summary of each command and the resulting problem.

## make format
- **Result:** completed successfully.
- **Output:** `All done!` with no changes required.

## make lint
- **Result:** failed because `flake8` was not installed.
- **Error:** `make: flake8: No such file or directory`.

## make test
- **Result:** failed when running Python tests.
- **Error:** `No module named pipenv` while trying to execute tests via Pipenv.

## make build
- **Result:** failed during TypeScript compilation.
- **Error:** `rimraf: not found`.

## make coverage
- **Result:** failed because pytest did not recognize coverage options.
- **Error:** `pytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --cov=./ --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term`.

## make simulate-ci
- **Result:** failed when the simulation script attempted to import PyYAML.
- **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`.

## make install
- **Result:** repeatedly created and removed virtual environments, then aborted.
- **Error:** virtual environment creation failed due to missing directories.

### Recommended Fixes
1. Install required Python tools such as `pipenv`, `flake8`, `pytest-cov`, `numpy`, `inflect`, and `PyYAML` either via `make setup` or dedicated requirements files.
2. Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed so utilities like `rimraf` are available.
3. Update the coverage configuration after `pytest-cov` is installed to remove argument errors.
4. Review the install target to avoid endless virtual environment creation.
