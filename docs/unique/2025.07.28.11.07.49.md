You're hitting on some deep tracks here — let's break this down, because you're circling some real and weird Lisp systems.

---

## 🧠 Major Lisp Dialects (You already know):

| Dialect         | Runtime          | Notes                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Common Lisp** | SBCL, CCL        | Powerful, old-school, native performance   |
| **Scheme**      | MIT/Gambit/Guile | Minimalist, academic, lots of variants     |
| **Clojure**     | JVM, JS, CLR     | Modern, immutable by default, data-centric |
| **Racket**      | Racket VM        | Scheme-based, macro paradise, DSL heaven   |

But then there are **fringe and embedded lisps** — the ones that *host* on other languages. That’s what you’re asking about.

---

## 🧩 Embedded/Hosted Lisp Dialects

These are Lisps that live inside other languages:

### 🟢 **Hy (Lisp for Python)**

This is *definitely* what you saw in that school assignment.

* Hy = Lisp syntax, **compiles directly to Python AST**
* Integrates seamlessly with Python — import any Python lib
* Can use `Cython` or Numba or anything Python can
* Perfect for writing macro-powered Python libraries

📦 Project: [https://github.com/hylang/hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy)
📘 Docs: [https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/](https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/)

**Example:**

```clojure
(defn hello [name]
  (print (+ "Hello, " name)))
```

Turns into Python’s:

```python
def hello(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)
```

**Great fit for:**

* DSLs in AI pipelines
* Configurable agents
* Transpilation into fast Cythonized modules

---

### 🔥 **Janet** (not Python-based but worth knowing)

* Small embeddable lisp, self-hosted VM
* Used in Reaper, and game engines
* Has coroutine + fiber support
* Think: tiny Fennel

---

### 🟣 **Fennel** (Lisp for Lua)

If you ever looked at Love2D (which I know you have), this is Lua + Lisp.
Tight interop with Lua — used in game scripting or small DSLs.

---

### 🐍 **Lisperati Deep Cuts: Hy + Cython**

What you probably saw was:

* Hy used to write logic in Lisp
* `hy2py` or AST pipeline used to emit clean Python
* Then **Cython** used to compile performance-heavy code

This is actually a sick pipeline:

```lisp
; hy code
(defn compute [x]
  (* x x))
```

→ transpiled to Python
→ passed into Cython for C-accelerated build
→ used in numerical computing / ML / embedded systems

---

## 🧬 Now\... Racket but More?

You might be thinking of:

### 🧠 **Typed Racket**

* Racket but with a sound type system
* Allows you to define types and still use macros
* Good for DSLs that need correctness guarantees

or maybe…

### 🧠 **Redex**

* A *meta-language* inside Racket for defining programming languages
* Not just a DSL, but a DSL for making DSLs
* Big in academia

or…

### 🧠 **Racket2** (WIP)

* The (possibly abandoned?) attempt to revamp Racket’s syntax
* Meant to modernize it without killing macro power

## 🧭 What to Use for Your DSL?

Given your system:

| Goal                              | Recommended Lisp                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Embed in Python, call STT/TTS/etc | **Hy**                                  |
| Full language design, macros, GUI | **Racket** or Typed Racket              |
| Embed in Lua game/sim engine      | **Fennel**                              |
| Custom host language              | **Sibilant** (for JS), or roll your own |
| Tiny runtime Lisp for agents      | **Janet**                               |

## 🛠 Bonus: Lisp + DSL Compiler Pipeline

Imagine writing:

```lisp
(deflayout sidebar
  (split vertical
    (pane (app "obsidian") (size 30))
    (pane (group "code"))))
```

In Hy → Compiled to Python → Used to generate AHK or invoke `komorebic`

Want a working example of this DSL in Hy? Or do you want to define the macro system structure first — how do we interpret `bind`, `group`, `layout`, etc.?

We can wire this into your Promethean system too. This could be the language your AI configures *itself* with.
