Ahh. Now *that’s* the constraint that bites hardest.

You’re in the worst kind of liminal space:

* You have a working i3 setup inside WSL ✅
* But you *can’t* run your real workloads there because the **Intel NPU isn’t exposed to WSL** ❌

This is a hardware boundary problem, not a UX one. So we need to **recreate the i3 workflow in native Windows**, where the NPU can actually run your workloads — which, frankly, **puts you in uncharted but not untraversable territory**.

## 🧠 Realistic Strategy Overview

Here's the system design lens I’d apply:

| Layer            | Desired Behavior                                      | Solution Sketch                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tiling UX        | i3-like window tiling with nested frames              | Extend Komorebi with grouping/cycling or fake frame manager |
| Automation Layer | Scripting/grouping/layout recall                      | Background agent managing window groups (in memory/db)      |
| Hardware Layer   | Use of NPU for inference or model workloads           | Run **native Windows apps only**, not via WSL               |
| Workflow Layer   | Quick layout switching, coding flow, distractions off | Keybind-managed layouts, pinned groups, saved layouts       |

## 🧰 So, what's viable?

### ✅ Native: **Komorebi as base WM**

Because you:

* Want keybinding-driven tiling
* Need your workloads to run on Windows-native apps (NPU support)
* Are comfortable extending tools if needed

**Komorebi is extensible.** You can create a daemon that:

* Tracks window groups (like i3 frames)
* Manages layout state
* Cycles visible windows in a group by hiding/showing/repositioning
* Exports/imports layouts per context

Even if this is fake nesting — as in, *"only one window from a group is visible at a time"* — it's better than nothing.

### ⚙️ Proposed Architecture

#### 🪟 Komorebi + Custom Group Manager

```plaintext
+------------------+
|  Your App        |
+------------------+
       ↓
+------------------+
| Komorebi (tiling |
| and layouts)     |
+------------------+
       ↓
+--------------------------+
| Group Manager Daemon     |  <-- You write this
| (tracks window groups,   |
| layout memory, input     |
| bindings via IPC/CLI)    |
+--------------------------+
       ↓
+------------------+
| Windows Hardware |
| + Intel NPU      |
+------------------+
```

Think of this like a "memory" layer that remembers how you mentally organize your workspace — which i3 did for you automatically — but now you’ll emulate manually.

---

### 🚀 Next Steps (If You're Game)

1. **Use Komorebi for core layout**

   * Learn its scripting/config
   * See how it handles rules and layouts
2. **Write a small layout/group manager**

   * Language: Node.js or Python
   * Responsibilities:

     * Track open windows and assign them to groups
     * Handle keybinds to swap visible windows in a group
     * Optionally restore layouts per project context
3. **Emulate i3-like frame switching**

   * e.g., `mod+1` toggles group 1 on left split
   * `mod+tab` cycles next window in that split

---

## 💡 Bonus: Use WSL as a Service Layer

You don’t have to abandon WSL either — here’s how you can still use it:

* Run WSL headlessly (no GUI)
* Expose tools and scripts as services over local ports
* Call those from your native Windows apps

For example:

* Use WSL for file indexing, AI data prep, task queues
* NPU-optimized Python scripts run natively on Windows
* Everything connects via CLI, IPC, or WebSockets

This pattern gives you the **Linux philosophy** on the backend, with **NPU acceleration** on the frontend.

---

## 🏁 TL;DR — What I'd Do

* Accept that you’re in Windows land, and it ain’t Linux.
* Use **Komorebi as your tiling base**
* Build a **small background manager** to handle window grouping and cycling like i3 frames
* Keep WSL around as a **toolbox**, not a desktop
* Run your AI/ML workloads natively to access the NPU

If you want, I can help you scaffold a `group-manager.ts` or `group_manager.py` service that can sit alongside Komorebi and give you more of the i3-style layout memory.

Would you like me to help sketch that out?
