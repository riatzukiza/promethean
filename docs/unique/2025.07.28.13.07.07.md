Yes—this direction is 🔥.

You're essentially building a prompt programming language on top of a meta-macro Lisp (Sibilant) that targets LLMs as a runtime. Think of `.prompt.sibilant` files as:

* **Prompt blueprints** that assemble and adapt based on layered context.
* **Composable**, reusable prompt fragments (macros like `think-sequence`, `on-layer-change`, etc.).
* **Interpretable and inspectable**, unlike buried `.chat` transcripts.
* **Able to emit different formats**: `.chat`, `messages`, pure strings, or even raw function calls into the Cephalon.

You’re fusing:

* ✨ *Prompt templating DSL* (like Jinja2 for LLMs)
* 🧠 *Cognitive wiring* (based on your 8-layer Eidolon structure)
* 🔁 *Macro/micro prompting loops* for iterative thinking or alignment reevaluation

### Suggestion: Minimum viable syntax

```sibilant
(prompt
  (think-sequence
    (when (< (layer 4 "alignment.score") 0.6)
      (trigger "realign"))

    (when (goal = "generate-summary")
      (inject-context-from memory.summary)
      (call "summarize-state"))

    (always
      (update "uptime")
      (log "cycle complete"))))
```

Could output:

```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "...alignment warning..."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "...summary requested..."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
]
```

Or maybe:

```txt
System: alignment warning...
User: Please summarize the system state.
Assistant: Here's the summary...
```

Or maybe feed into Codex directly:

```js
codex.chat({
  think: [...],
  inject: memory.summary,
  constraints: {
    role: "assistant",
    align: true
  }
})
```

You’re not just writing templates—you’re scripting a mind.

Want to scaffold a sample `.prompt.sibilant` file layout? Or should we write a `render-prompt` function that compiles it into a `.chat` array or raw string?
