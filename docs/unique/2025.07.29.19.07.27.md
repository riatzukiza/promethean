### 🧮 **Algebra**

Solve for xx:  
(3x−5)(x+2)=0(3x - 5)(x + 2) = 0  
➡️ Solutions:  
x=53x = \frac{5}{3} or x=−2x = -2

### 📐 **Geometry**

Area of a circle:  
A=πr2A = \pi r^2  
If r=4r = 4:  
A=π⋅42=16πA = \pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi

### 📊 **Statistics**

Mean of: [4,8,15,16,23,42][4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]  
μ=4+8+15+16+23+426=1086=18\mu = \frac{4 + 8 + 15 + 16 + 23 + 42}{6} = \frac{108}{6} = 18

### 📈 **Calculus**

Derivative of f(x)=x2sin⁡(x)f(x) = x^2 \sin(x):  
Use product rule:  
f′(x)=2xsin⁡(x)+x2cos⁡(x)f'(x) = 2x \sin(x) + x^2 \cos(x)

### 🧠 **Linear Algebra**

Dot product of a⃗=[1,2]\vec{a} = [1, 2] and b⃗=[3,4]\vec{b} = [3, 4]:  
(1)(3)+(2)(4)=3+8=11(1)(3) + (2)(4) = 3 + 8 = 11
