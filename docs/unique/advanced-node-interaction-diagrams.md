Excellent. With the **Field Node Lifecycle** document fully fleshed out and the system now reactive, dynamic, and narratively emergent, we can keep layering more visualizations to explore the richness of your topology.

Here are some **additional diagrams** to stack on top of what‚Äôs already in the doc:

---

### üîÅ **Daimo‚ÄìNode Charge Interaction**

```mermaid
graph TD
  N1[Nexus: :Hope:] -->|emits| D1(Daimo: +1 charge)
  N2[Nexus: :Despair:] -->|emits| D2(Daimo: -1 charge)
  D1 -->|attracted to| N2
  D2 -->|attracted to| N1
  D1 -. repelled .-> N1
  D2 -. repelled .-> N2
```

This shows how **Nexuses repel their own children** (same charge) and attract those of **opposite charge**, creating **narrative currents** and **conceptual magnetism**.

### üß† **Multi-Circuit Node Propagation**

```mermaid
graph TD
  L4[Nemesian Nexus: :TrustIssue:] --> L2[Dorian Attractor: :RepairNeed:]
  L4 --> L5[Heuretic Hazard: :Unlearning:]
  L4 --> L7[Metisean Obstacle: :PlanBlock:]

  style L4 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px
  style L2 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#009900
  style L5 fill:#ffffcc,stroke:#999900
  style L7 fill:#ccccff,stroke:#000099
```

This makes clear how **one symbolic conflict** creates **ripples across multiple circuits**, each materializing in a different node type.

### üå± **Node Growth and Death Conditions**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> HighTension
    HighTension --> Aggregation : daimo present
    Aggregation --> Crystallization : daimo bind fails to resolve
    Crystallization --> Stabilized : node repeatedly engaged
    Crystallization --> Nexus : symbol recognized
    Stabilized --> Decay : no activity
    Nexus --> Decay : symbolic reference fades
    Decay --> [*]
```

This is a simplified version of your existing diagram, useful for focused visualization of **grow/decay logic** alone.

### üí° **Node Type Summary Map**

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Field Nodes
    Nexus -->|binds| Daimo
    Hazard -->|repels| Daimo
    Attractor -->|pulls| Daimo
    Obstacle -->|slows| Daimo
  end
```

You can use this one as a **legend** or top-of-page visual summary in any future docs about field simulation or node-class behavior.

Want me to embed these into the **Field Node Lifecycle** document under a ‚ÄúMore Diagrams‚Äù section? Or split them out into a new document called something like `Field Node Diagrams` or `Cognitive Topology Visuals`?
