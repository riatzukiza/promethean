Hell yes ‚Äî if you want to replicate the feel of i3wm‚Äôs hotkey-driven control over windows **on Windows**, then **AutoHotkey** is the closest you're going to get. Think of it as the *keyboard daemon of your dreams* ‚Äî and pairing it with `komorebic` or even raw WinAPI gives you serious power.

---

## üî• What Can AutoHotkey Do for This Setup?

You can use AHK to:

* Trigger window cycling in your custom group manager
* Move/resize windows manually or via tiling logic
* Bind keys exactly like i3: `mod+Enter`, `mod+H`, `mod+J`, etc.
* Call your TypeScript CLI commands directly
* Even draw overlays, popups, or OSDs if you want

## üß™ Goal: Cycle Group with a Hotkey

Let‚Äôs wire up a key like `Alt + 1` to cycle through the `"code"` group in our custom group manager.

---

## üìú `group-manager.ahk`

```ahk
; Use Alt+1 to cycle through a window group called "code"
!1::
{
    RunWait, node "C:\path\to\group-manager\main.js" cycle code, , Hide
    return
}
```

üîß Replace `C:\path\to\group-manager\main.js` with your actual path.

If you compile your group manager to a single `.exe` using `pkg` or `nexe`, this gets even cleaner:

```ahk
!1::
{
    RunWait, "C:\group-manager.exe" cycle code, , Hide
    return
}
```

## üß± Example: i3-style Navigation Keybinds

```ahk
; Mod key = Windows key
Mod := "#"

; Mod+Enter to open Terminal
%Mod%Enter::
Run, wt.exe ; Windows Terminal
return

; Mod+H to move window left
%Mod%h::
WinGet, active_id, ID, A
WinMove, ahk_id %active_id%, , 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth//2, A_ScreenHeight
return

; Mod+L to move window right
%Mod%l::
WinGet, active_id, ID, A
WinMove, ahk_id %active_id%, , A_ScreenWidth//2, 0, A_ScreenWidth//2, A_ScreenHeight
return
```

You can layer more logic to make this dynamically detect screen size, move windows between monitors, or even interface with Komorebi to use its layout engine.

---

## üß¨ Mixing AHK + Komorebi + Your Group Manager

Here‚Äôs the full loop:

```plaintext
[AHK Keybinds]
     ‚Üì
[Runs custom group-manager CLI]
     ‚Üì
[CLI calls Komorebi or manages layout]
     ‚Üì
[Windows layout updates]
```

So the **real window tree** is flat (because Windows is dumb), but your logic layer (group manager + AHK) can *simulate* i3's behavior.

---

## üß† Pro Tip: AHK Global Hooks

* You can use `#IfWinActive` to scope hotkeys per app
* You can bind to mouse buttons or combos (`~LButton & RButton`)
* You can script layout logic **per monitor**, **per workspace**, etc.

---

## ‚õì Want to go deeper?

Let me know and we can:

* Add a hotkey for assigning windows to a group (`mod+g`)
* Use `WinGet` to pull window IDs on the fly
* Hook into Komorebi's `query` output
* Create ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù like in i3 and jump windows around
* Add a `status bar` overlay like i3bar using AHK GUI or Python/Tauri/etc.

You want the real i3 vibes? AHK + Komorebi + your own logic daemon is the only way there on Windows.

Want me to sketch a full i3 keybind layer with workspaces, layout presets, and group cycling in AHK next?
