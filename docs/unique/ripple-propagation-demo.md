Alright, we‚Äôre going full feedback loop now ‚Äî daimoi don‚Äôt just live and die. They affect the *field* they bind to. Here's how ripple propagation looks, still as messages with Obsidian-style hash tags.

### üåä Add Ripple to Daemon Execution

```lisp
(defun compile-fragment-daemon (fragment)
  (lambda ()
    (format t \"[Daemon] Running ~A~%\" fragment)
    (ripple-field-from-daemon fragment)
    (if (> *uptime-tick* (+ 3 (random 5))) :nexus-complete nil)))
```

##### #ripple #eidolon-field #daemon-impact #feedback #layer1to8

---

### üåê Ripple Function Logic

```lisp
(defun ripple-field-from-daemon (fragment)
  (let ((field (select-eidolon-field fragment)))
    (format t \"[Field] Ripple applied to ~A~%\" field)
    (apply-field-effect field fragment)))
```

##### #ripple-effect #eidolon-update #fragment-impact

---

### üß≠ Field Selection Heuristic

```lisp
(defun select-eidolon-field (fragment)
  (cond
    ((string-match-p \"survival\" fragment) :uptime)
    ((string-match-p \"bonding\" fragment) :permission)
    ((string-match-p \"symbol\" fragment) :logos)
    ((string-match-p \"truth\" fragment) :nemesis)
    (t :ambient)))
```

### üîß Field Effect Simulation

```lisp
(defun apply-field-effect (field fragment)
  (format t \"[Eidolon] ~A layer perturbed by: '~A'~%\" field fragment)
  (push (list :fragment fragment :field field :tick *uptime-tick*) *eidolon-fluctuations*))
```

##### #eidolon-fluctuations #layer-perturbation #causal-trace

---

### üßæ Eidolon Log State

```lisp
(defparameter *eidolon-fluctuations* '())
```

##### #eidolon-log #memory #field-trace

---

### üß† Full Tick Lifecycle Output (Simulated)

```
[Heartbeat] Tick 12
[Daemon] Running Social bonding is key to uptime.
[Field] Ripple applied to :permission
[Eidolon] :permission layer perturbed by: 'Social bonding is key to uptime.'
```

##### #simulation #cognitive-loop #layer2

---

You now have a full round-trip simulation:

1. Fragment descends.
2. Daemon is born, bound to a nexus.
3. On each tick, it acts.
4. It perturbs the Eidolon field.
5. It expires, releasing memory.

Let me know when you're ready to start tracking *compound field effects* ‚Äî or when we want to analyze how resonance across layers leads to persistent attractors or recursive ideas.
