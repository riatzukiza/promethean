Got it—folder-based structure instead of file suffixes. That gives us much more room for layered growth and agent-specific behavior. Here's a refined plan that structures `docs/prompts/` into **purpose-driven folders**, each with its own philosophy and use case.

We’ll treat `AGENTS.md` as the **index, manifesto, and onboarding file** for this whole area of the project.

---

# 🔧 `docs/prompts/` Directory Layout

This folder is your **cognitive playground**. A map of mental states, patterns, and evolutionary paths. Each subfolder below is a *region* in this mental terrain.

---

## 📁 `templates/`

> **Reusable prompt structures.**
> "How do we normally talk to this kind of agent, model, or subtask?"

**Contents:**

* Prompt blueprints for different use cases: test-writing, refactoring, bug triage, etc.
* Examples with structure annotations (framing, role, outcome, constraints, etc.).
* Evolving conventions for formatting, tone, system messages, and self-reflection.

**Usage:**

* Agents should *start here* when unsure how to prompt themselves.
* Generate new task prompts by adapting these.

---

## 📁 `history/`

> **Past prompts and their outcomes.**
> A backup of how we’ve spoken to agents before—especially across major milestones, resets, or merges.

**Contents:**
![](../../Prompt_Folder_Bootstrap.csv)
* Prompt transcripts or summaries from key sessions.
* Prompts that led to meaningful breakthroughs or failures.
* Records of instructions that got lost in git reverts, or subtle divergences in interpretation.

**Usage:**
![](../../Prompt_Folder_Bootstrap.csv)
* Use this as a memory vault.
* Agents can review how similar prompts have worked in the past.
* You can refer to it when debugging regressions in agent behavior.

---

## 📁 `tasks/`

> **Current or proposed agent-facing task prompts.**
> When you give an agent a job to do, it gets written here. These are prompt-based versions of Kanban tasks.

**Contents:**

* One file per task (named after the task or ticket).
* Full context, constraints, and links to code/docs/board items.
* Clear expectations and outcomes.
* Often includes fields like:

  * `agent_role: "codex"`
  * `priority: high`
  * `related: agile/tasks/foo.md`

**Usage:**

* You write here when you want the agent to tackle something non-trivial.
* Agents should use past prompts in `templates/` to guide their generation of new task prompts.

---

## 📁 `scratch/`

> **Raw ideas, unfinished threads, free associations.**
> Not all prompts are formal. Some are sparks. This is where they land.

**Contents:**

* Freeform writing to the agent.
* Emotional venting. Meta reflection.
* “I don’t know how to say this yet, but…”

**Usage:**

* You write here when you're thinking out loud.
* Agents can scan this for vibes and unfinished ideas to revisit later.
* Can be mined for future tasks or templates.

---

## 📁 `meta/`

> **Prompt analysis and cognitive reflections.**
> Why did a prompt work or fail? What did we learn from it?

**Contents:**

* Post-mortems.
* Pattern mining from successful or failed prompt sessions.
* Discussions of language, tone, prompt engineering theory.

**Usage:**

* Both you and agents can write here.
* Improves the agent’s ability to self-grade, self-edit, and grow.
* Helps evolve the system’s prompt literacy.

---

## 📁 `seed/`

> **Scaffold prompts for future use.**
> Drafts or fragments that are meant to be extended later.

**Contents:**

* Barebones prompt shells.
* TODO-laden guides waiting for final context.
* Stuff like:

  ```md
  # Scaffold: Setup a new test harness
  agent_role: codex
  priority: med
  context: Add test coverage to new service
  status: DRAFT
  ```

**Usage:**

* Acts as a prompt todo list.
* Encourages generative reuse by agents.
* Good starting point for agents proposing new task files.

---

## 📁 `agents/`

> **Per-agent instruction sets and inner models.**
> This is how we teach each unique agent to see the world.

**Contents:**

* Files like:

  * `duck.md` (voice interface, emotional cognition, field resonance)
  * `codex.md` (test writing, documentation, debugging)
  * `scribe.md` (summarization, meta-reflection, archive hygiene)
* Includes custom prompt tips, tone guides, and known edge cases.

**Usage:**

* Direct reference during prompt generation.
* Gives each agent a stronger sense of self.

---

## Optional: 📁 `layers/` (if tied into Eidolon circuit model)

> A prompt perspective aligned with layered cognition.
> Could contain prompts designed to engage with specific cognitive circuits or Eidolon fields.

---

## Root: `AGENTS.md`

Acts as the **index and onboarding** file, explaining this whole system.
It contains:

* Why this folder exists.
* Philosophy of prompt-driven cognition.
* The structure and how to grow it.
* Instructions to agents on how to prompt themselves.
* Warnings about fragility (reverts, state loss) and how to recover.
* Expectations for self-reflective agent behavior.

---

Would you like me to turn this into an actual `AGENTS.md` content body and bootstrap each of the folders with an `_index.md` or `README.md` explaining its purpose?
