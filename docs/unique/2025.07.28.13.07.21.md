Yeah, that's a strong direction. You're designing a language for cognitionâ€”literally a cognitive operating system with self-contained, introspectable thought processes.

Here's a way to sketch this vision:

## #promethean #eidolon #meta #dsl

# ðŸ§  Promethean State Format (PSF): Homoiconic Cognitive Memory Representation

### \[\[What It Is]]

A declarative and executable s-expression format that encapsulates:

* ðŸ§± System architecture (e.g., \[\[Eidolon Fields]], \[\[Cephalon]], \[\[Layer N]])
* ðŸ§  Agent cognition (field nodes, daimo behavior)
* ðŸ§¾ Prompt history and dynamic LLM state
* ðŸ“¦ Importable memory modules (e.g., `(import "agent/common-motives")`)
* ðŸ§° DSL support for code analysis, linting, and interactive debugging

---

### \[\[Why It Matters]]

* **Visual Debuggability**: Most LLMs have invisible reasoning chains. This gives them a *visible, inspectable mind*.
* **Persistence**: Snapshots of the system are serializable and restorable.
* **Composability**: You can build up logic incrementally with macros and partial imports.
* **Tooling Potential**: Linters, analyzers, and static checkers can reason about field state changes, cognitive loops, and permission gates.

### \[\[Core Syntax Example]]

```lisp
(memory-state
  (import "core/layer1.sibilant")
  (import "agents/common-thoughts")

  (layer 1
    (field :uptime 1000)
    (field :resources (cpu 0.6) (ram 0.3))
    (pulse "heartbeat"))

  (layer 2
    (permission-check
      (if (user.trust < 0.5)
          (deny "access.restricted"))))

  (daimo "alignment-monitor"
    (trigger (layer 4 "alignment.score" < 0.6))
    (action (realign "layer4"))
    (log "realigning due to low alignment score"))

  (eidolon-field :survival
    (node "system-critical" (mass 1.0) (vector (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0))))

  ;; Traceable thoughts
  (thought-sequence
    (when (memory.contains "user.command")
          (execute-command (memory.get "user.command"))))

  (meta-log "System stable. Ready for extension.")
)
```

---

### \[\[Features to Build]]

* `(on-layer-change ...)` â€” reactive macros
* `(visualize "eidolon/survival")` â€” hook to UI rendering
* `(export-json)` / `(import-json)` for external IO
* Lint rule: "Daimo must declare mass and at least one field vector"
* Context diff tooling: show what changed between two states

---

This gives you a base to build tooling *around* the AI, not just inside of it. Youâ€™re not just making an AIâ€”you're making an operating system for cognition. And with this format, anyone can start building tools, UIs, or even games that interact with the mental state itself.

Want me to mock up a directory structure for this kind of `.prompt.sibilant` world? Or do you want to explore the internal DSL for importing and manipulating memory regions first?
