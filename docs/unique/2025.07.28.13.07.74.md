Perfect â€” glad the highlighter is behaving now. Let's go deep into the DSL.

## ðŸ§  Context So Far (Recap)

You're using **Sibilant** not just as a Lisp-to-JS compiler, but as a **meta-string templating engine** where macros can generate deeply structured code in *any* language. We've started sketching a DSL that:

* Represents **thinking sequences** (`think-sequence`, `when`, `always`, etc.)
* Will be able to **switch contexts or runtimes** depending on the active layer (layer-based metacognition)
* Can **trigger realignments**, conditionally rebuild prompts, or re-evaluate current system state
* Needs to emit **prompt templates** for LLMs, potentially stitched from memory chunks
* May need to serialize/deserialize **cross-runtime data** (e.g., JSON, typed buffers)

## ðŸ§¬ Next DSL Components

Letâ€™s build a few foundational macro ideas:

---

### 1. `define-runtime` â€” Register an external language environment

```sibilant
(define-runtime "python"
  (command "python3")
  (entrypoint "main.py")
  (type "subprocess") ;; could be "websocket", "ffi", etc.
)
```

Would compile to:

```js
(register-runtime "python", {
  command: "python3",
  entrypoint: "main.py",
  type: "subprocess"
});
```

---

### 2. `on-layer-change` â€” Trigger meta-macros when layer state shifts

```sibilant
(on-layer-change 4
  (when (< "alignment.score" 0.5)
    (log "realigning...")
    (trigger-realignment)))
```

---

### 3. `prompt-template` â€” Compose a reusable prompt with metadata

```sibilant
(prompt-template "explain-current-goal"
  (context "goals.memory")
  (llm "llama3")
  (template
    "Explain what the current goal is:"
    "{{goal.name}}"
    "Why is it important?"
  ))
```

---

### 4. `think-sequence` (already started) â€” Layer-aware, continuous reasoning step

```sibilant
(think-sequence
  (when (goal? "assist-user")
    (try-action "respond"))
  (always
    (update-context)
    (pulse-uptime)))
```

---

### 5. `define-field` and `update-field` â€” Eidolon-style dynamic fields

```sibilant
(define-field "fear" (dimensions 8) (decay-rate 0.01))
(update-field "fear" (+input "user.presence"))
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Macro Expansion Philosophy

Weâ€™ll use the Sibilant `meta` layer to inject runtime hooks or emit code to different target languages:

```sibilant
(meta (defmacro prompt-template (...body)
         ;; process args, build string, emit doc, return macro output
         ...))
```

This is how weâ€™ll eventually let Sibilant:

* Generate full `.md` prompt files
* Register context metadata
* Track usage per LLM
* Debug via dynamic logs at compile-time

### ðŸ”§ Want to define the `think-sequence` macro more deeply next?

Or would you rather design a structure for prompt-building (`prompt-compose`, `chunk`, `slot`, etc.)?
