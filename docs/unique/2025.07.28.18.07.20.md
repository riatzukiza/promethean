Here's your board, reorganized to align with the process doc and maximize automation and agent utilization. I’ve:

* Moved bot-actionable tasks (e.g., #codex-task, clear spec) into **Prompt Refinement**, **Agent Thinking**, or **Breakdown** depending on structure.
* Moved tasks with no links to the appropriate **Breakdown** or **Accepted** stage to encourage documentation.
* Preserved your columns and tags so agents can begin chipping away at them.

### ✅ Reorganized Kanban Snapshot

#### 🧊 Ice Box (Raw ideas)

*unchanged*

---

#### 💭 New

*none*

---

#### ✅ Accepted

✔️ Kept:

* [ ] Migrate server side sibilant libs to Promethean architecture.
* [ ] Annotate legacy code with migration tags

🆕 Added (was in `Incoming`, needs refinement/spec):

* [ ] Add Ollama formally to pipeline
* [ ] Smart Task templater
* [ ] Start Eidolon

---

#### 🔍 Prompt Refinement

📌 Bot can begin prompt shaping.

* [ ] Migrate portfolio client code to Promethean
* [ ] write simple ecosystem declaration library for new agents
* [ ] Implement fragment ingestion with activation vectors #codex-task
* [ ] Detect contradictions in memory #codex-task
* [ ] Suggest metaprogramming updates #codex-task

---

#### 🤔 Agent Thinking

🧠 Conceptual or reflection tasks, good for Codex or Agent mode:

* [ ] Evaluate and reward flow satisfaction #framework-core
* [ ] Identify ancestral resonance patterns #framework-core
* [ ] Implement transcendence cascade #framework-core
* [ ] Create permission gating layer #framework-core

---

#### 🧩 Breakdown

🔧 Needs actionable subtasks, specs, or linked documents.

* [ ] \[\[Create base `README.md` templates for each service]]
* [ ] \[\[Set up `Makefile` for Python + JS build test dev]]
* [ ] Ensure GitHub-compatible markdown settings are documented *(no link yet)*
* [ ] Obsidian Kanban <-> GitHub Project Board Mirror system
* [ ] Migrating relevant modules from `riatzukiza.github.io` to `/site/` and `/docs/`
* [ ] Build data structures for Eidolon field #codex-task
* [ ] Create permission gating layer #codex-task

---

#### 🚧 Blocked

(consider moving tasks here if you define permission/env/dependency needs)

---

#### 🛠 Ready

✔️ Kept:

* [ ] \[\[Finalize `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`]]
* [ ] Structure vault to mirror `services`, `agents`, `docs`

---

#### 🟢 To Do

(ready for human or agent to start)

---

#### 🟡 In Progress

* [ ] Add vault instructions to main `README.md` *(duplicate flag—may be Rejected)*

---

#### 🔍 In Review

* [ ] Add `.obsidian/` to `.gitignore`
* [ ] Write `vault-config/README.md` for Obsidian vault onboarding

---

#### 📚 Document

*(may emerge automatically from In Review/Done)*

---

#### ✅ Done

✔️ No changes needed

---

### 🧠 Notes (unchanged)

Let me know if you'd like a script to:

* Auto-move board items based on tag + doc-link presence
* Generate missing stubs for `[[ ]]` notes
* Suggest concrete next steps for Prompt Refinement → Breakdown flow

We’re entering phase two of the system: **shared cognition**. The board now reflects that.
