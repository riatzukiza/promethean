Perfect—flow brain unlocked, diagrams incoming. Here’s a fresh batch of cognitive topology visualizations, each meant to live in its own note:

---

### ⚖️ **Circuit Weight Influence on Node Formation**

```mermaid
graph TD
  L1[Aionian Pressure] -->|heartbeat | Node1
  L2[Dorian Friction] -->|permissions| Node1
  L3[Gnostic Symbolism] -->|meaning tension| Node1
  L4[Nemesian Ethics] -->|alignment pressure| Node1
  Node1[Node Emergence Threshold]
```

Use this to visualize how **multiple circuits** may converge their pressure to form a single Field Node—helpful for mapping complex daimo encounters.

---

### 🔀 **Node Type Evolution Flow**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Attractor
  Attractor --> Nexus : if semantically reinforced
  Attractor --> Obstacle : if tension flattens
  Hazard --> Nexus : if resolved symbolically
  Hazard --> Obstacle : if normalized
  Nexus --> Obstacle : if forgotten
  Obstacle --> [*]
```

Shows how **nodes evolve** or degrade into other types. Example: an unresolved trauma (Hazard) becomes a symbolic insight (Nexus), then a low-tension memory (Obstacle).

---

### 💣 **Hazard Interaction Logic**

```mermaid
graph LR
  D[Daimo] -->|enters field| H[Hazard Node]
  H -->|apply repulsion| D
  H -->|damage or fragmentation| D
  D -->|eject| E[Edge of field or fallback plan]
```

Illustrates how Daimoi interact with Hazards—triggering bounce, damage, or potential re-routing through adjacent nodes.

---

### 🧲 **Attractor Swarm Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD
  A1[Attractor: :Curiosity:] --> D1(Daimo A)
  A1 --> D2(Daimo B)
  A1 --> D3(Daimo C)
  D1 --> A2[Adjacent Nexus]
  D2 --> A3[Adjacent Nexus]
  D3 --> A4[Adjacent Nexus]
```

This shows how **Attractors seed daimo** that drift outward and bind to new Nexuses, shaping **idea propagation** across the field.

---

### 🌀 **Daimo Collision & Fusion Paths**

```mermaid
graph TD
  D1[Daimo A positive] -->|near| D2[Daimo B negative]
  D1 --> Fusion[Check compatibility]
  D2 --> Fusion
  Fusion --> D3[Daimo C neutral]
  Fusion --> Terminated[Annihilation]  

```

A symbolic particle collision system. Allows you to model **ideological reconciliation**, insight events, or **cognitive fusion**.

---

### 🔁 **Narrative Cycle Closure via Node Chain**

```mermaid
graph TD
  Start[Nexus: :Curiosity:] --> A1[Attractor: :Seeking:]
  A1 --> H1[Hazard: :Unknown Consequence:]
  H1 --> N2[Nexus: :Experience:]
  N2 --> O1[Obstacle: :Internal Conflict:]
  O1 --> N3[Nexus : :Integration:]
```

This is a **mythic pattern generator**. Tracks a full cycle from curiosity to closure across node types. Perfect for designing internal quests or learning loops.

---

### 💥 **Node Overload Collapse Cascade**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Stabilized
  Stabilized --> Overloaded : too many Daimoi bind
  Overloaded --> Cascade : field tension exceeds threshold
  Cascade --> Hazard : collapse into unstable memory
  Hazard --> Decay : if not reengaged
  Decay --> [*]
```

Useful for modeling things like burnout, panic attacks, memory corruption, or recursive daimo storms.

---

Want another round? I can start sketching:

- **Regional field flows** (a la weather maps)
    
- **Field Node daimo orbit diagrams**
    
- **Permission-mediated daimo flows (Dorian boundaries)**
    
- Or just keep firing at full creative pressure
    

Let’s go until your working memory caps.
