You're not crazy — what you're describing is the deep window container hierarchy i3 uses via *split containers* and *tabbed/stacked containers*, effectively allowing you to build a **tree of window frames**, with each node being a layout manager in itself. And yeah, **Windows just doesn’t work like that natively**, because it lacks a proper composable window management API and treats windows mostly as top-level entities with limited nesting capabilities.

Let’s break this down and look at what **might** be possible on Windows:

---

## 🧠 The Goal (Summarized)

You're after:

* **Tiling window management**
* **Nested containers / window frames**
* **Custom layouts with collapsible groups**
* **Keyboard-driven control**
* **Ability to cycle windows inside a group**

---

## 🧰 The Reality of Windows

Windows **doesn’t natively support nested containers** for top-level windows like X11 + i3 does. All windows are peers in a flat hierarchy under the desktop window, unless apps themselves implement tabbing or embedding via Win32 APIs (think MDI, which is dead).

To *emulate* this, you’d need to either:

1. **Fake the container** by having the window manager create new *host windows* that contain child windows and manually re-parent/manage layout.
2. Or more realistically, **simulate the UX behavior**, even if the implementation is totally different.

## 🧪 Comparing the Two

### ✅ GlazeWM

* **Go-based**, fast, scriptable.
* Supports basic i3-style **horizontal/vertical** tiling and keybindings.
* Lacks *deep nesting* — just one level of layout.

### 🔧 Komorebi

* Written in C++, inspired by **yabai** (macOS) and **bspwm** (Linux).
* Much more **programmable**, with layout scripting and direct window control.
* **More hackable** for what you want, but definitely a steeper learning curve.

👉 If you're looking to try i3-like hierarchy simulation, **Komorebi is the better base** — it’s the only one of the two that’s trying to act like a *true* tiling compositor with the potential to hijack or fake nested layout behavior.

## 🛠️ Could We Emulate i3's Nested Frames?

To some degree. Here's a few conceptual directions:

### 1. **Virtual Containers as Tiling Groups**

* You implement a concept of *groups* or *frames* in your tiler.
* Each group tracks a set of windows and layouts.
* Only the *active* window of a group is visible at a time (like tabs).
* You can cycle between windows in a group with keybinds.
* Each group’s layout can be saved/restored.

🧱 **Komorebi might support this** if you extend it or wrap it with a scripting layer that manages window groups.

---

### 2. **Actual Window Reparenting?**

* You could (theoretically) **create fake parent containers** using win32 `HWND`s and forcibly **re-parent windows** into them.
* Windows **hates this** though. Apps don’t expect it, and you can run into Z-order, input, and focus bugs.
* But it’s not impossible. Tools like [bug.n](https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n) and [Amethyst Windows fork](https://github.com/glsorre/amethyst-windows) have *dabbled* in it.

⚠️ This path is dangerous but fascinating.

---

### 3. **Use Multiple Desktops as Layout Buckets**

* Treat each virtual desktop as a “frame” or “workspace”.
* Group windows into specific desktops using a helper tool (e.g., [VirtualDesktopAccessor](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor)).
* Quickly switch views and layouts.

This is **indirect** but useful if you're okay trading nesting for mental grouping.

---

## 🧭 Recommendation

If you're serious about replicating i3’s container model:

### 🔨 Fork or Extend Komorebi

* It's low-level enough to allow you to simulate nested containers.
* You can **write a layer on top** that tracks frame state, manages layouts, and toggles visibility.
* Could write this in Rust or TypeScript if you add an IPC layer.

### 🧪 Alternative: Build a Custom WM Layer

* Use AutoHotKey + Win32 + a layout manager service (e.g., a background Node.js daemon).
* This layer manages window states, positions, and layout logic.
* Tricky, but gives you **complete control** — like a fake i3.

---

## 🧵 Longer-Term Direction?

Honestly… if you're deeply tied to this model and **live in the matrix like I suspect you do**, you may want to consider:

* **Dual-booting a Linux setup** for your focused dev tasks
* **Using WSLg** on Windows 11 to run i3 in a WSL container
* Or even **building your own tiling layer** on top of Windows — it’s not as crazy as it sounds.

There’s no perfect solution yet. Windows is **not designed for composable UIs**, and every tiler on Windows is fundamentally working *against* the platform.

But Komorebi? That’s your best bet **right now**. If you want help scripting a fake container system on top of it, I can help you prototype one.
