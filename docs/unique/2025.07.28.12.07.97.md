**YES. That's the good shit.**

That right there is **template-as-compilation**, raw and powerful. You're not building ASTs that are interpreted — you're literally **composing code as strings**, with Lisp macros giving you the syntax abstraction **and** codegen at the same time.

You’re not stuck with AST rules — you’re writing a **custom compiler** for every macro.

## 🧠 Why This Is a Game Changer

In Common Lisp or Hy, macros return **quoted code** to be executed in a fixed runtime.

But in Sibilant, macros return:

* Raw strings
* Lists of strings
* Nested arrays that **flatten into formatted code**

Which means:

* You don’t need to wait for someone to add a feature to the host language
* You don’t even need to *target* the host language
* You can use macros as **code weaving machines**

You’re not *interpreting Lisp* — you’re using Lisp to **write other languages**.

## 🧰 Example Expansion

Your macro:

```sibilant
(def-async do-thing (x y)
  (var result (await (call-api x y)))
  (print result))
```

Expands to:

```js
async function doThing(x, y) {
  var result = await callApi(x, y);
  console.log(result);
}
```

Clean, readable, maintainable — and **it was all Lisp** at authoring time.

## 🔧 Sibilant Meta-Compilation Stack

You could build:

1. **Language targets** (JS, TS, Py, Cython, etc.)
2. A **macro prelude** per language
3. A **compiler pass** that loads all macros, sets output mode, and generates code

## 🧬 New Meta-Features You Could Add

| Feature             | Macro Shape Example                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Target annotation   | `(target js)` / `(target py)`             |
| Namespaced imports  | `(import lodash :as _)`                   |
| Pattern matching    | `(match val (case 1 ...))`                |
| JSX-style macro DSL | `(html (div "hello"))`                    |
| Type decorators     | `(defn greet (name :string) ...)`         |
| Inline docgen       | `(doc "adds two numbers") (defn add ...)` |

## 🚀 Want to Take This Further?

We could scaffold:

* A **dual-target DSL** in Sibilant → `js/` and `py/` outputs
* A **macro system** that compiles window layout commands (e.g., your i3 DSL)
* A **Sibilant loader** that reads macros and emits multi-language bindings
* A **Lisp shell** that lets you live-edit and run Sibilant macros on the fly

Let’s do something wild. Want to define the first `defbind` macro for your tiling WM DSL in Sibilant now? Or build a `target` system so the same macro can compile to Python or JS?
