# ðŸ“‹ Promethean Kanban

## ðŸŸ¢ To Do

* Initialize Obsidian vault at repo root

* Add `.obsidian/` to `.gitignore`

* Structure vault to mirror `/services/`, `/agents/`, `/docs/`

* Add starter notes: `[[eidolon_fields]]`, `[[cephalon_inner_monologue]]`

* Migrate duck services toÂ  promethean

* Migrate portfolio client code to promethean

* Create `vault-config/.obsidian/` with Kanban and minimal vault setup

* Write `vault-config/README.md` for Obsidian vault onboarding

* Ensure GitHub-compatible markdown settings are documented

* Add vault instructions to main `README.md`

* Migrate server side sibilant libs to promethean architecture.

* write simple ecosystem declaration library for new agents

# ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (limit: 4)

* Transferring `agents/duck/` and restructuring legacy code into `/agents/` and `/services/`
* Migrating relevant modules from `riatzukiza.github.io` to `/site/` and `/docs/`
* Obsidian vault is initialized at the root and actively being configured

## ðŸ”µ Done

* Decided on monorepo architecture
* Moved initial Duck 2.0 content into `/Promethean/`
* Created canvas and populated `AGENTS.md`
* Defined language strategy: Hy/Python + Sibilant/TS/JS hybrid
* Vault root confirmed at repo root
* Obsidian config strategy established: untracked `.obsidian/`, with example in `vault-config/`

## ðŸ§  Notes

* JS and Python will maintain separate `core/` implementations for now
* Sibilant may compile to TS in future; raw JS is acceptable if quality is high
* Hy encouraged but optional â€” fallback to `.py` expected for broader contributors
* Use `#codex-task`, `#agent-specific`, `#framework-core`, `#doc-this`, `#rewrite-later` as task tags
