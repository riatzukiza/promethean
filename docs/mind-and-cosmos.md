# ðŸ§© Mind and Cosmos

This note reflects on ideas discussed about consciousness, embodiment, and the universe in relation to the Promethean Framework.

- **Embodied cognition** links a simulated or physical body to perception and action. It grounds reasoning in experiences, helping an agent learn in a more general way.
- **Physics and mental models** blend to form a system that is part simulation, part emotional and cognitive architecture, and part machine learning pipeline.
- **Contemplating the universe** reminds us of vast scales and complex laws. It offers context for the projectâ€™s goal of building adaptable agents that interact with their environments.

Promethean seeks progress toward AGI by weaving these threads together, placing an embodied agent within a richly modeled world while drawing from statistical learning and cognitive theory.
