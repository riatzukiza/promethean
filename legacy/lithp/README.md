# LITHP


It's got a lisp? Get it?

Forkedish from sibilant. Minor changes to suit libraries I based on sibilant better. That work will be merged into here.
Currently a super set of sibilant. All sibilant code (should) also compile if using this compiler. It does for me at the time of writing this.

Currently stil uses the `.sibilant` extension. In the future will also accept the `.lith` and `.lithp` extensions.
