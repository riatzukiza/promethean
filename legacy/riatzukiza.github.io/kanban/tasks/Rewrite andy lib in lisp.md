There were some useful things in here but all [done](../done.md) with classes and that doesn't work with the properly prototypal interface pattern I am using.

## Tasks

- [ ] Andy's gl library is moved into portfolio
- [ ] Lisp interfaces are defined for every class in the library
- [ ] The obstacles simulation works as before
- [ ] performance is not impacted by new implementation
