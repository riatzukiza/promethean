# Camera System

A system that allows us to zoom in and out on the map. It allows us to scroll cross tile.


## Requirements

- Mouse click/hold events on the game canvas for dragging the view.
- Mouse wheel events that allow the camera to zoom in and out.
- No visual artifacts when viewing the edges of the map where the coordinate system tiles.
