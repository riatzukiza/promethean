# Config system

For component systems to leverage my config file I have to inject it manually and it is a little annoying to do. I want a more streamlined way of using config files that is integrated with the rest of the game systems.

This is pretty simple to do, and I think I've already kinda [done](../done.md) it?

I had somthing a little different than the hack I did in mind though.

Like [each](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) component should be individually configurable, accepting a config interface as a parameter for initialization

## Requirements

- shared standardized config interface integrated with @shared component system.
