# Github Readme

Pretty straight forward, github needs a [readme](../../readme.md) to explain to everyone coming to the code from github to understand what this repository is. I want to generate the [readme](../../readme.md) from a collection of documents like this one.

## Requirements

- introduction
- this kanban is a part of it
- A link to the [Home page](Home%20page.md)
- A link to the projects
- A brief explaination of [each](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) [project](../project.md)
