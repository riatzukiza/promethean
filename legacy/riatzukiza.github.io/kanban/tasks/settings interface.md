# Settings interface

While I have a quick settings interface, it is just somthing I found when I found the code that inspired the signal vector field concept. In the same area as the entity inspecter and placement pallette will be located, there will be an interface for updating the simulation settings.

Sine I've already got work started on interface components it makes sense for me to add prioritize this.

## Requirements

- pairity with old quicksettings menu
