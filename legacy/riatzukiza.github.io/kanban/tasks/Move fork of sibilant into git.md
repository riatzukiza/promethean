We made a fork of sibilant and hosted it on bitbucket. We use this version of sibilant in the package.json file. It is likely the source of the unknown content warnings.

The language will be called Lithp after this point. (like if you said Lisp with a lisp. Li(th)p). The extensions will be .lith

## Requirements
- The code for our lisp is hosted in this repo
- the language is renamed.
- The language recognizes new file extensions.
- The emacs layer recognizes the new file extensions
