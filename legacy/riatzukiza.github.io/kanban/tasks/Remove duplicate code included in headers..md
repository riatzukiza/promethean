# Description 

The way I wrote the kit framework ended up adding a lot of duplicate code to the top of a lot of files.

To [remove](../../docs/Shared/datastructures/trees/binary-search-tree/remove.md) these, I need to move the kit macros into the portfolio and refactor them a bit. This task can probably be consoldated into the [kanban/tasks/Move all outside work into the portfolio git](Move%20all%20outside%20work%20into%20the%20portfolio%20git.md)
