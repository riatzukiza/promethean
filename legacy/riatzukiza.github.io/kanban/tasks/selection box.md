We want to be able to drag a box around entities for selection. Selected entities will show up in a panel and be highlighted.

## Requirements

- Mouse click, hold, and [release](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/release.md) events for dragging a box
- A box appears when the mouse is held and dragged
- Entities with in the box are highlighted 
- When the mouse is [release](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/release.md), the highlighted entities are displayed in a panel.
- There is a different highlighted color for entities that are selected and ones that are in a box to be highlighted upon mouse up event
