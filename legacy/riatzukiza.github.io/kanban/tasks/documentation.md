Some interfaces from the object pools have doc macros attached to them automaticly generating document markdown files from the source code. It started out as a bit of a hack, this task is centered around documenting existing code using that hack. A seperate piece of work will be genreated for enhancing the document macro system.

## Requirements

- Every major system has been documented
- The documents are published and viewable on the static github website.
- Every major system has an example associated with it.

I'm going to document everything I touch while I work on other things. We 
know the doc macro works, we just have to use it.
