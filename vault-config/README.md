# Vault Configuration

This folder contains a minimal Obsidian configuration for the Promethean vault.
Copy the `.obsidian/` directory to the repository root if you want to use the
same baseline setup and enable the included plugins.

```bash
cp -r vault-config/.obsidian .obsidian
```

The configuration only enables the **Kanban** plugin so the board in
`docs/agile/boards/kanban.md` renders properly. After copying the folder,
launch Obsidian and open the repository directory as a vault. Your personal
settings remain local and are not tracked by git. Feel free to install
additional plugins or customize the theme.
