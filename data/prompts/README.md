# Prompt Templates

This directory contains text templates used to initialize or guide language models in the Promethean framework.

## Source
The initial template was migrated from `services/ts/cephalon/defaultPrompt.txt`.
Additional prompts may be added here as development continues.

## Format
All files are plain UTF-8 encoded text. Each template should be a standalone prompt that can be loaded by services when starting an agent.

## Licensing
Unless otherwise noted, prompts are distributed under the repository's main license.

## Intended Use
These templates seed agent personalities and interactions. They are examples meant for experimentation and testing. Review each prompt carefully before deploying in production.
